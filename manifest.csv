...Heavy rain returns to the Gulf Coast and heavy snow for the
northern Rockies...

Heavy rain and thunderstorms will be making a return to portions
of the Deep South and into the Tennessee River Valley to begin
2020.  There will be a deep surge of moisture from the western
Gulf of Mexico ahead of a longwave trough over Mexico and a warm
front lifting northward across the Gulf Coast region.  Current
indications suggest 2 to 4 inches of rainfall from Louisiana to
southern Tennessee, and there may be some instances of flooding
with a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall from WPC in effect for
parts of these areas.  A few strong to severe thunderstorms can
also be expected.

For the Pacific Northwest, a pair of cold fronts will make their
way inland with a surge of moisture off the Pacific.  The result
will be heavy rain for coastal areas of Washington and Oregon, and
heavy snow for the Olympics and Cascades.  The central and
northern Rockies will also be affected by these storm systems with
at least a foot of snow possible for the higher elevations of
northern Idaho and western Montana through Thursday morning.

Elsewhere across the continental U.S., lake effect snow is
expected downwind of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario as cold
northwesterly winds cross the warmer waters.  Mainly dry
conditions are expected across the Florida Peninsula, the Desert
Southwest, and the central Plains.  Much of the central and
eastern U.S. should begin the new year with temperatures near to
above normal, and near to below normal for the Rockies and parts
of the Intermountain West."

...Heavy rains, isolated flash flooding and isolated severe
weather possible across the Lower Mississippi Valley and central
Gulf Coast...

...Above average temperatures expected across much of the
country....

...A powerful northeast Pacific storm will push a strong front,
high winds and heavy rains into the coastal Pacific Northwest by
late Friday...


An increasingly wet pattern taking shape the first few days of
2020 from eastern Texas, northeastward across the Lower
Mississippi Valley, central Gulf coast, Tennessee Valley, Ohio
Valley and into the Mid-Atlantic.  An amplifying mid to upper
level trof over the Southern Plains will transport above average
levels of moisture northeastward from Wednesday night through
Thursday, supporting the heavy rainfall potential across these
areas.  In addition to the heavy rains, there is slight risk of
severe weather and flash flooding Thursday across portions of the
Lower Mississippi Valley into the Central Gulf Coast associated
with this precipitation.

In addition to transporting above average levels of moisture
northeastward, the amplifying mid to upper level trof over the
Southern Plains will also support a broad region of above to much
above average temperatures from the mid section of the nation into
the east.  Above average temperatures also expected across much of
the west coast into the Great Basin.  The only exception to the
above average temperature regime across the nation will continue
to be through the Rockies and portions of the Southwest where
temperatures are expected to be slightly below average over the
next two days.

Tranquil weather will persist across much of the west coast this
period.   However, a powerful, rapidly deepening low over the
northeast Pacific late Thursday into Friday will push a strong
front toward the Pacific Northwest coast on Friday.  Strong winds
and heavy rains are possible along the Washington State and Oregon
coasts by Friday evening.

Happy New Year!"

...Heavy rain returns to the South and another storm system for
the Northwest...

Widespread moderate to heavy rain and thunderstorms have made a
return to the Gulf Coast region as a moisture rich disturbance
lifts northward from the Gulf of Mexico.  This feature will be
ahead of a longwave trough over Mexico and the High Plains, and a
warm front lifting northward across the Gulf Coast region will
provide additional instability for some strong to severe
thunderstorms.  The Storm Prediction Center has a Slight Risk of
severe thunderstorms across portions of Louisiana and Mississippi
for Thursday.  In terms of heavy rainfall, current indications
suggest the potential for 3 to 5 inches of rainfall from central
Mississippi to eastern Tennessee, and there will likely be some
instances of flash flooding where there are multiple rounds of
thunderstorm activity.  Flood watches are in effect for these
areas.

For the Pacific Northwest, heavy rain can be expected for coastal
areas of Washington and Oregon, and heavy snow for the Olympics
and Cascades.  By Friday night, a strong cold front approaches the
region with a powerful surface low crossing British Columbia.  The
result will be strong winds and high surf for the coastal areas,
and additional heavy precipitation can be expected for the Pacific
Northwest and northern Rockies as this front moves inland Saturday
morning.

Elsewhere across the continental U.S., mainly dry conditions are
expected across the Desert Southwest and extending eastward to the
central Plains.  Much of the central and eastern U.S. will have
temperatures that feel more like March instead of January ahead of
the cold front, and near to below normal for the Rockies and parts
of the Intermountain West."

...Flash flooding and severe weather possible Thursday night into
Friday across portions of the Lower Mississippi Valley, Tennessee
Valley and Southeast...

...A strong front will bring heavy precipitation and high wind
potential for large portions of the northwestern U.S. Friday into
Saturday...


The amplifying mid to upper level trof over the mid section of the
nation will keep wet conditions across a large portion of the
eastern U.S. over the next two days as much above average values
of moisture continue to stream northeastward across these areas. 
This will result in moderate to heavy amounts of rain from the
Lower Mississippi Valley..across the Gulf coast...Ohio and
Tennessee Valleys and into the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast.  Flash
flooding will continue to be a threat Thursday night into early
Friday across portions of the Lower Mississippi Valley into the
Tennessee Valley where some of the heaviest rainfall amounts are
expected. 

The precipitation ahead of the amplifying mid to upper level trof
over the mid section of the nation will be in the form of rain as
above average temperatures continue to dominate large sections of
the nation over the next two days.  There may be the potential for
record high minimum and maximum temperatures on Friday from
Florida into portions of the Southeast.  

A rapidly deepening area of low pressure off the Pacific Northwest
coast Friday will push a strong frontal boundary quickly eastward
into the Pacific Northwest Friday night and then across the
Northern Rockies into the Northern Plains by Saturday.  This front
will be accompanied by heavy lower elevations rains and higher
elevation snows across the Pacific Northwest Friday night into
early Saturday and heavy snows across the Northern Rockies on
Saturday.  In addition, high winds are likely across the Pacific
Northwest late Friday into Saturday as the front moves inland. 
These high winds will also be spreading inland into portions of
the Great Basin and into the lee of the Northern to Central
Rockies on Saturday."

Great Lakes with high temperatures running roughly 15-25 degrees
above average. High temperature departures of 10-15 degrees above
average will affect the East Coast.

Given slow movement of the front across the Mississippi River
Valley and moisture spreading northward, showers and thunderstorms
are expected to develop Thursday night into Friday from eastern
Oklahoma into the Ohio Valley. Locally heavy rain will be possible
into portions of Illinois and Indiana where heavy rain over the
past 1 to 2 weeks has left soils less able to take on additional
water. However, as a potent upper level disturbance moves out into
the Southern Plains, strong to severe storms are expected to
develop from eastern Texas into Louisiana and Arkansas Friday
afternoon where the Storm Prediction Center is highlighting an
Enhanced Risk of severe thunderstorms. Flash flooding will also be
possible with these storms, especially farther north from eastern
Oklahoma into Arkansas and southern Missouri. A wintry mix will
also develop on the northwest side of the precipitation shield,
likely impacting portions of eastern Kansas into southern
Wisconsin and northern Illinois. The storm system will continue
through the weekend, moving from west to east."

An upper-level trough over the western half of the contiguous U.S.
will strengthen tonight and Friday as additional energy comes in.
A frontal system at the surface will move slowly through Friday as
the trough develops, before both features move eastward this
weekend. Moisture from the Gulf of Mexico will flow into the
vicinity of the fronts, leading to increasing rain chances today
and especially on Friday for the Southern Plains into much of the
Mississippi and Ohio Valleys. After rainfall of up to an inch in
those areas today into tonight, rainfall totals are forecast to be
3 to 5 inches on Friday and Friday night in a swath from far
northeastern Texas to eastern Oklahoma, northwestern Arkansas, and
southwestern Missouri. Thus, there is a Moderate Risk of flash
flooding in those areas for Friday. Flood and Flash Flood Watches
are in effect across much of Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana ahead
of the rainfall. Additionally, the Storm Prediction Center has
outlooked an Enhanced Risk of severe weather on Friday for parts
of the Southern Plains to Lower Mississippi Valley.

On the backside of this system, light to moderate snow is expected
in the Intermountain West and Rockies today, spreading eastward
tonight and Friday. A wintry mix of snow, sleet, and freezing rain
is possible in portions of the Southern/Central Plains into the
Middle Mississippi Valley and northeastward into the Great Lakes
region Friday into Saturday after the cold front drops the
temperatures. Freezing rain amounts of over a tenth of an inch are
currently forecast for parts of Missouri into southeastern Iowa.

The strong front will also lead to significant temperature
anomalies across the country. Ahead of the front, high
temperatures will be 15 to 25 degrees above average from the
Plains into the Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee Valleys today,
with low temperatures Friday morning more than 30 degrees above
normal over a large part of that area--widespread record high
minimum temperatures are expected to be set over the next couple
of days. The Eastern Seaboard will join in on the warmth on
Friday. Colder than average temperatures are forecast for the
western half of the country, however, due to the first front and a
secondary cold front which is expected to reinforce the cold air.
By Friday, high temperatures in the single digits are forecast for
the north-central tier of the nation.     

Another low pressure system is forecast to approach the Northwest
on Friday, which combined with more upper-level energy will lead
to heavy precipitation. Rain is forecast for lower elevations of
the Pacific Northwest, with snow elsewhere from the Cascades to
the Northern Great Basin and Northern Rockies. Through Friday
night, heavy snow of over 2 feet is expected in higher elevations
of the Cascades, with the Northern Rockies expecting snow totals
in excess of a foot."

A strengthening trough will be in place over much of the western
states into the weekend. Meanwhile surface fronts will slowly move
eastward while providing a focus for a broad area of 1 to 2+
inches. The rainfall coverage and intensity will steadily increase
along the High Plains, Midwest and for portions of the Mississippi
Valley where Gulf moisture will feed northward near the fronts
resulting in an additional 1 to 3 inches. Due to the slow
progression of this system, storm motion will be slow and expected
to track over the sames area. This will become become problematic
as soils become saturated. A large portion of the central U.S.
will likely reach or exceed flash flooding conditions. The area
will the best possibility for excessive rainfall spans from
northeast Texas to southwest Missouri, with a broader area from
eastern Texas/western Louisiana to southern Michigan.
Additionally, the Storm Prediction Center has outlooked a Moderate

A powerful winter storm will produce numerous weather hazards to
much of the eastern U.S this weekend. Today, severe thunderstorms,
heavy rain and flash flooding will impact much of the Central Gulf
Coast/Lower Mississippi Valley into the lower Great Lakes. Further
north, snow accumulations will range from a six to twelve inches
across northern Michigan. Signifiacnt ice accumulations of a
quarter to one half inches over Michigan and Northern Maine will
lead to treacherous travel conditions, power outages, and tree
damage tonight and into Sunday. Some ice accumulations may
approach one inch in far northern New York. Gusty winds are
anticipated behind the storm which is why wind advisories are
issued across a large portion of the eastern U.S..

Between one to two inches of heavy rain is on tap across the
Southeast, the eastern Great Lakes, and northern New England. A
slight risk of excessive rainfall is forecast over parts of
Tennessee Valley/Lower Mississippi Valley northeastward to the
Western Ohio Valley and parts of the Great Lakes where prolonged
heavy rainfall, coupled with overly saturated soil, will lead to
areas of flooding this evening The most flood-prone locations will
be urban areas, roads, and small streams. Plus, the Storm
Prediction Center maintains an enhanced risk of severe weather for
parts of the Central Gulf Coast/Lower Mississippi Valley and
Tennessee Valley through tonight with severe storms capable of
producing tornadoes and damaging winds. Tornado Watches remain in
effect for portions of the Deep South through this evening.

Ahead of this storm system, much of the East Coast is getting a
very early glimpse of spring as temperatures soar into the 60s and
70s. Numerous daily high and warm overnight low temperature
records are expected to be broken up and down the East Coast today
and into Sunday. Despite the storm system's cold frontal passage
on Sunday, the colder air behind the system presently will modify
by the time it reaches the East Coast. This will result in
""cooler"" temperatures to start the week, but temperatures will
remain 5 to 15 degrees above normal across most eastern regions.

The Pacific Northwest will witness another storm system approach
the region on Sunday, then track into the northern Rockies on
Monday. Moderate to heavy snow over the Intermountain West and
Northern/Central Rockies will continue through Monday. Snow
accumulations will be measured in the highest peaks of the
Cascades, while one to two feet of snow are likely in the higher

approaches. A stationary boundary draped across the region will
continue to produce heavy snow for the Cascades. 1-2 feet are
probable with isolated amounts higher than 2 feet possible through
Wednesday. The low pressure system will arrive Wednesday evening
just as the Upper level low deepens. This combination will produce
up to another foot over parts of the Pacific Northwest mountains
while the associated cold front will dump up to 2 feet across
parts of the Sierra on Thursday.

Meanwhile, another upper level trough out ahead of the Pacific one
will spawn a new low pressure system over the lee side of the
Rockies tonight. This low will go on to produce snow, rain and
freezing rain for much of the Upper Mississippi Valley/Great Lakes
and Midwest, up through the Northeast on Wednesday and Thursday.
2-4 inches of snow is likely for the Upper Mississippi
Valley/Great Lakes with an isolated area of 6 inches possible for
a portion of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan Wednesday. Snow will
ramp up over northern New England as the low strengthens on it's
way out to sea Thursday night. 6-8 inches of snow are expected for
much of this area.

A Slight Risk of Excessive Rainfall leading to flash flooding is
in effect for parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley and Southern
Appalachians due to the presence of a stationary boundary oriented
diagonally across the Southeast. Isolated areas of over an inch
possible for these areas.

Above normal temperatures will continue over Northern Montana, but
the coldest of the temps will retreat back to the Canadian border

Southern California by overnight Thursday.  This combination will
produce up to another foot over parts of the Pacific Northwest
mountains while about 2 feet of snow will fall across parts of the
Sierra Nevada Mountains on Thursday starting to wane on Friday.

Furthermore, weaker upper-level energy and moisture moving
northward over the Plains will aid in producing rain, snow, and
rain/freezing rain over parts of the Southern Rockies/Southern
Plains on Thursday expanding into parts of the Middle Mississippi
Valley on Thursday night into Friday.  The wintry mix will produce
hazardous travel conditions.

Meanwhile, upper-level energy over the Northern Rockies/Plains
will spawn a new low pressure system over the Middle Mississippi
Valley.  This low will go on to produce snow, rain and freezing
rain for much of the Upper Mississippi Valley/Great Lakes and
moving into the Northeast on Thursday.  2-6 inches of snow is
likely for the Upper Mississippi Valley/Great Lakes with an
isolated area of 8 inches possible for a portion of the Upper
Peninsula of Michigan.  Snow will ramp up over Northern New
England as the low strengthens while moving out to sea Thursday
night producing 6-8 inches of snow.

A Marginal Risk of Excessive Rainfall leading to isolated flash
flooding is in effect for parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley

A very strong area of low pressure currently focused offshore of
the Pacific Northwest will be advancing inland tonight and
traversing the Intermountain West Thursday through early Friday.
This will drive a surge of Pacific moisture which coupled with the
cold air currently pooled across the interior should yield heavy
snowfall for the Olympic Mountains, the Cascades and extending

of snow will be possible for the highest elevations going through
Friday morning. Meanwhile, heavy rain is expected for the
immediate coastal ranges of Washington, Oregon and central to
northern California where locally a few inches of rain is expected
for the event by the end of the week.

This winter storm will then reorganize by late Friday out across
the High Plains and aim for the Midwest by Friday evening. As it
does so, moisture returning north from the Gulf of Mexico will
allow a widespread area of precipitation to break out, including a
swath of locally heavy snow, sleet and freezing rain from portions
of the central Plains northeast through the Upper Midwest. This is
expected to result in a fairly widespread area of travel
difficulty over the central U.S. by Friday night, with very
slippery roads and locally poor visibility. Several inches of snow
can be expected with this system as it advances east.

Ahead of this system though will be a significant change in
temperatures across the eastern U.S. as very mild temperatures for
this time of the year will give way to the arrival of an area of
Arctic high pressure surging southeast down from Canada tonight
and Thursday in the wake of a quick-moving storm system crossing
the Great Lakes region this evening, and New England by early
Thursday. A swath of heavy snow is expected with this system, with
some areas over portions of northern New York and northern New
England expected to receive in excess of 6 inches of snow by

An upper-level low will amplify as it crosses the Central Rockies
Friday morning. This will develop a strong surface low pressure
system over the Central Plains that will track across the Midwest

tenth of an inch is possible for much of this area. A Slight Risk
of Excessive Rainfall is in effect for the Mid-South extending

front of the storm system.

Heavy snow continues for the Sierra as the Pacific system
continues crossing inland toward the interior West. Snowfall

the week. Frigid daily low temperatures that dip below zero will
be common across the Northern Plains and Midwest Monday morning.
By Tuesday and Wednesday, some of the more anomalously cold

temperatures will extend as far south as north-central Florida. On
average, much of the eastern half of the country will see
temperatures anomalies range between 10 to 20 degrees below
normal. Look for lake effect snow showers to persist overnight and
into Monday morning.

The first in a pair of low pressure systems will approach the
Northwest resulting in light rain and some higher elevation snow
in the Cascades on Monday. As this system dissipates offshore
tomorrow, a second but more potent storm will send a large plume
of moisture will reach the West Coast late Monday into Tuesday.
Periods of rain will be common in the lower elevations of the
Pacific Northwest and northern California while mountain snow
falls across the Cascades and northern Sierra Nevada. This storm

likely. Further south, an influx of moisture will track across the
Southwest tonight and Tuesday leading to light rain and mountain
snow accumulations. Portions of the Rockies of Colorado, Utah, and
Wyoming can all expect measurable snowfall Tuesday and into
Wednesday.

The disturbances tracking through the West will reach the Plains
Tuesday night and into Wednesday. As high pressure moves over the
eastern U.S. on Wednesday, a moist southerly flow will develop

bring more rain/snow to the region. Two-day storm total snowfall
amounts are expected to be highest in the Washington and Oregon
Cascades, where one to two feet can be expected and even higher in
the northern Washington Cascades.

A weaker upper level system is tracking through the Southwest this
evening with mountain snow and lower elevation rain. This system
will eject out into the Southern Plains with mostly rain breaking
out across Texas, but with a mixture of rain and snow found across
Oklahoma tonight into Wednesday morning. Additional wintry weather
will extend northward into the Missouri Valley along with light
ice accumulations. Snow accumulations should stay on the light
side, with two to four inches from northeast Kansas into the Upper
Great Lakes through Thursday night.

Cold weather will remain east of the Mississippi tonight, with low
temperature departures running roughly 10 to 20 degrees below
average. Thanks to high pressure across the Mid-Atlantic and a
potent low pressure system to the east, Florida will be
particularly cold. Wind chill values in the teens and 20s will be
felt across central and northern portions of the state tonight
into Wednesday morning. Some moderation will occur on Wednesday
along and west of the Appalachian Mountains. However, below
average temperatures will remain across eastern Texas/Oklahoma
into the Lower Mississippi Valley in association with the storm
system approaching from the west mentioned earlier. However, up
north a warmer trend is anticipated from the northern High Plains
spreading east into the Great Lakes region for Wednesday. High
temperature departures for Wednesday will run a good 10 to 20
degrees above average from eastern Montana and Wyoming into and
across the Upper Mississippi Valley."

Great Lakes through Thursday...

...Cold start across Florida this morning, followed by a warming
trend for the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic...

A series of storm systems will impact the Pacific Northwest over
the next few days which will keep the region rather unsettled.
Ongoing coastal rain and mountain snow in the Pacific Northwest
will increase in intensity during the day today, with snow
changing to rain for elevations below 6000 to 7000 feet as warmer
Pacific air flows into the region this evening. Heavy rain will
continue for western Washington through Thursday but the focus for
heavier rain will spread southward along the coast into
northwestern Oregon in connection with a cold front. Two day
rainfall totals of 3 to 6 inches are expected through Friday
morning for upslope regions of the Cascades, Olympics and Coastal
Ranges which may produce flooding.

Across the central U.S., a mixture of precipitation types will
occur over the next couple of days as warm and moist air from the
south meets with existing cold air in place through the Central
Plains and Midwest. All rain will occur from southern
Oklahoma/Arkansas to the Gulf Coast with locally heavy rain for
the middle and upper Texas coastline this evening and Wednesday
night. Freezing rain accumulations near a tenth of an inch or
greater will impact portions of the Ozarks where a Winter Weather
Advisory is in place. In fact, Winter Weather Advisories extend
north from the Ozarks into the nation's Heartland and Upper
Midwest where light to moderate snowfall accumulations are
forecast through Thursday morning. After the initial round of
precipitation moves through, a second, more potent upper level
disturbance will amplify through Kansas and Oklahoma toward the
Mississippi Valley for Thursday. Additional snow for central
Missouri and Iowa may generate two-day snowfall totals of 4-6
inches in some locations.

After a frigid start to their Wednesday morning in Florida, where
Freeze Warnings and Wind Chill Advisories are in effect across all
of the Sunshine State, a return to more typical weather is
expected. Gusty winds in association with a deepening coastal low
centered offshore of Florida will subside tonight into Thursday
morning combined with warmer temperatures. A return to southerly
flow will allow a warming trend for the rest of the week,
impacting the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions with high
temperatures returning close to average for Friday."

...Active weather with flooding possible over the Pacific
Northwest...

An upper-level trough over the Plains to Midwest is forecast to be
reinforced by additional, more potent upper-level energy on
Thursday. This combined with a myriad of surface fronts will lead
to precipitation across portions of the Plains into the
Mississippi Valley and Upper Great Lakes region through Thursday.
Rain is expected for much of the Lower Mississippi Valley, but
freezing rain will be a threat for the Ozarks, with greater than a
tenth of an inch of ice forecasted there. Farther north, 4 to 6
inches of snow is expected for northern Missouri into the Upper
Midwest and Upper Great Lakes. As a surface low pressure system
consolidates Thursday night into Friday and moves northeast, snow
will spread into parts of Pennsylvania and New York, while some
freezing rain potential exists in the Central Appalachians, and
rain is forecast for the Tennessee Valley, Southeast, and southern
parts of the Mid-Atlantic.

Periods of precipitation will continue for the Northwest through
the end of the workweek as ample moisture flows into the region
and a front passes through slowly. Upslope flow is expected to
enhance precipitation totals of the Cascades, Olympics, and
Coastal Ranges. The lower elevations should remain all rain for
the precipitation type, and flooding is possible in western
Washington and northwestern Oregon through Thursday night. Snow
levels are actually expected to rise to 5000-6000 feet Wednesday
night, so rain could fall on snowpack in some areas, but some snow
is expected in the highest peaks of the Cascades and into the
Northern Rockies.

Temperatures over the contiguous U.S. will generally be near to
above average over the next couple of days. Cooler spots are
forecast to be portions of the Lower/Middle Mississippi Valley and
into the Southeast on Thursday, but minimum temperatures should be
at or above average most everywhere by Friday morning."

A complex frontal system developing over the MS Valley is expected
to produce areas of light to moderate snow from the mid MS Valley
to the upper Great Lakes through tonight. Rain is expected for
much of the Lower Mississippi Valley.  A few embedded thunder
showers
are possible there, too. As cold air dams against the southern
Appalachians, light freezing drizzle or freezing rain is possible
in western NC and SC.

As a surface low pressure system consolidates Friday and moves
northeast into the mid MS Valley, snow will spread north of the
low into western MI and WI. Further east,warming aloft changes
snow to mixed sleet and freezing rain in the Central Appalachians.
A period of rain is forecast for the Tennessee Valley, Southeast,
and the Mid-Atlantic.

On Saturday, the new low developing in the mid Atlantic spreads
the rain north into New York and southern New England.
Further inland in New York and New England, warming aloft changes
snow into sleet and freezing rain. Interior New Hampshire and
Maine may see freezing rain amounts of a quarter to half of an
inch.

Periods of precipitation will continue for the Northwest through
the end of the workweek as ample moisture flows into the region
and a front passes through slowly. Upslope flow is expected to
enhance precipitation totals of the Cascades, Olympics, and

higher peaks of the Cascades and into the Northern Rockies.
Locally heavy snow is expected in the highest elevations of the
northern WA Cascades.

Temperatures over the contiguous U.S. will generally be near to

A complex frontal system over the Mississippi Valley this
afternoon is expected to produce areas of light to moderate snow
from the Upper Midwest through the upper Great Lakes region
through tonight. This storm system will advance east on Friday and
Saturday as low pressure crosses the Ohio Valley and moves into
the lower Great Lakes. Moisture advancing out ahead of this will
interact with sufficient cold air for some areas of accumulating
snow to develop across the remainder of the Great Lakes region,
and also the interior of the Northeast where locally a few inches
of snow can be expected going through Saturday. Shallow low-level
cold air will be in place for the threat for some freezing rain
and associated icing too along the eastern slopes of the central
and southern Appalachians and the northern Mid-Atlantic region
tonight and Friday before warmer air arrives and promotes a
changeover to rain. This will include an area from the far western
Carolinas north to western Pennsylvania. On Saturday, areas of
freezing rain are expected to develop for the interior valleys of
northern Pennsylvania, New York and adjacent areas of New England.

Aside from the winter weather component of this storm system,
heavy rain will be another concern as rainfall totals of as much
as 1 to 2 inches with locally heavier amounts can be expected for
the central and southern Appalachians and much of the Mid-Atlantic
and southern New England going through Saturday. This will be the
result of a new area of low pressure developing over the coastal
plain of the Southeast by Friday which will quickly lift northeast
and arrive near the western end of Long Island by late Saturday.
Given the relatively wet antecedent conditions and heavy totals,
some areas of flooding will be possible.

Meanwhile, multiple bouts of heavy precipitation will continue for
the Northwest through the end of the week and into the weekend as
a series of cold fronts move in off the Pacific Ocean. This will
include heavy rain for the coastal ranges where as much as a few
inches of rain will be possible, and also heavy snow for the
higher peaks of the Washington and Oregon Cascades where as much
as 2 feet of new snowfall can be expected.

Temperatures over the contiguous U.S. will generally be near to
above normal over the next couple of days going into the weekend.
One exception will tend to be over the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast
where temperatures overall will be perhaps a few degrees below
normal."

There will be no shortage of active weather in the eastern U.S.
this weekend thanks to a potent upper-level low pressure system
slowly advancing towards the East Coast. Periods of snow will be
most common in the Midwest and Great Lakes where several inches of
snow will accumulate. Hazardous travel conditions are possible in
parts of these aforementioned regions for the Friday morning
commute. As the storm pushes east late Friday, so will its shield
of precipitation which will encounter low level cold air in parts
of the central and northern Appalachians Saturday morning. In
response, precipitation will fall in the form of snow and freezing
rain from northern Pennsylvania early Saturday to northern New
England Saturday night. Over a tenth of an inch of ice
accumulation is possible in the higher elevations of the Northeast
with a couple inches of snow also in play. Expect snow showers to
linger around the Great Lakes into Sunday morning. The I-95
corridor will look to remain mostly rain for the duration of this
storm system.

To the south, heavy rain will be a concern as rainfall totals of
as much as 1 to 2 inches with locally heavier amounts can be
expected in the Virginia Blue Ridge on south to the Smokey
Mountains later today. Rainfall rates may be high enough to
generate areas of flash flooding in portions the central
Appalachians and over the Virginia and Maryland Piedmont this
evening and early Saturday morning. The plume of moisture
associated with this system will advance north and east Saturday
into the Northeast with heavy showers and breezy conditions along
the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast coasts. Most locations neighboring
the I-95 corridor will receive around 1"" of rainfall with locally
higher amounts possible. Drier conditions will arrive first in the
Mid-Atlantic Saturday evening while the Northeast will have to
wait to dry out until Sunday morning.

Switching coasts, several rounds of heavy precipitation will
continue over the Northwest through into the weekend as a series
of Pacific cold fronts push into the region. Heavy rain will be
the primary precipitation type for the coastal ranges and valleys
where as much as a few inches of rain are possible. Meanwhile, the
Washington and Oregon Cascades will contend with heavy snow where
snowfall totals as much as 2 feet are anticipated. Look for this
active weather pattern to continue into the start of the upcoming
week.

Weekend temperatures across the contiguous U.S. will generally be
near to above normal. The warmest anomalies will be found in the
Great Lakes, Upper Midwest, and Intermountain West. One exception
to this milder trend will be the Southeast where temperatures
overall will average a few degrees below normal."

There will be no shortage of active weather over the eastern U.S.
this weekend thanks to a potent upper-level low pressure system
slowly advancing towards the East Coast. Winter Weather Advisories
are in effect for portions of the Midwest, Great Lakes and
Northeast where locally several inches of snow will accumulate
through tonight. Also, there will be the threat for some areas of
freezing rain, especially across the northern Appalachians and
interior portions New York and New England later tonight and
through Saturday as the storm pushes east, and interacts with
shallow subfreezing temperatures. Hazardous travel conditions can
be expected locally, but fortunately the major cities of the
Mid-Atlantic and Northeast should be warm enough for just plain
rain.

Aside from the winter weather impacts, heavy rain with the storm
system will be a concern as rainfall totals of as much as 1 to 2
inches are expected tonight through Saturday for the Mid-Atlantic
and southern New England. However, even heavier amounts reaching
up to 3 inches or more are expected for the higher terrain of the
Appalachians, including the Blue Ridge from southern Pennsylvania
southward to western North Carolina. These rainfall totals may be
enough to result in some flooding problems given the relatively
wet antecedent conditions. As the storm system lifts northeast
through New England by Sunday and begins to pull away, drier and
somewhat colder air will arrive from the Midwest, although there
should be plenty of snow shower activity across the Great Lakes
and central Appalachians on Sunday with locally a few inches of
snow possible.

Meanwhile, multiple bouts of heavy precipitation will continue for
the Northwest into the weekend as a series of cold fronts move in
off the Pacific Ocean. This will include heavy rain for the
coastal ranges where as much as a few inches of rain will be
possible, and also heavy snow for the higher peaks of the
Washington and Oregon Cascades where as much as 2 feet of new
snowfall can be expected through the weekend. Some of this heavy
snowfall will also spill over into the Intermountain West with
locally heavy accumulations for the northern Rockies.

Weekend temperatures across the contiguous U.S. will generally be
near to above normal. The warmest anomalies will be found over the
High Plains, Upper Midwest, and Great Lakes region which is mainly
a reflection of the level of milder upstream Pacific air advancing
east across the country, and a lack of any cold high pressure
dropping south from Canada."

A large upper level low pressure system will be responsible for
the wet and wintry weather many residents of the Great Lakes and
Northeast will experience today. Starting with the wintry impacts,
parts of the western Great Lakes will receive several additional
inches of snow Saturday. Look for snowfall to taper off by
Saturday evening in these areas. Further east, snow and freezing
rain may be problematic in the central and northern Appalachians
as snow accumulations up to one inch and a glaze of ice is
expected. The Poconos and Catskills will see the wintry weather
first this morning, followed by the Adirondacks and northern New
England Saturday afternoon. Winter Weather Advisories are in
effect for these mountainous locations as travel could be
hazardous in spots.

Aside from the winter weather impacts, heavy rain with the storm
system will be a concern as rainfall totals of as much as 1 to 2
inches are expected this morning for the northern Mid-Atlantic and
southern New England. The best chances for localized flooding will
be early this morning in portions of northern Virginia and central
Maryland. As the storm system lifts northeast through New England
by Sunday and begins to pull away, drier and somewhat colder air
will arrive from the Midwest. There should continue to be plenty
of snow shower activity across the Great Lakes and central
Appalachians on Sunday with locally a few inches of snow possible.

Meanwhile, multiple bouts of heavy precipitation will continue
across the Northwest throughout the weekend as a series of cold
fronts move in off the Pacific Ocean. This will include heavy rain
for the coastal ranges where several inches of rain are expected
with locally higher amounts exceeding 5 inches possible. In
addition to the rain, heavy snow will fall over the higher peaks
of the Washington and Oregon Cascades where as much as 2 feet of
new snowfall can be expected through the weekend. Some of this
heavy snowfall will reach the Intermountain West with locally
heavy accumulations in the northern Rockies.

Weekend temperatures across the contiguous U.S. will generally be
near to above normal. The warmest anomalies will be focused over
the High Plains, Upper Midwest, and Great Lakes regions. This
seasonally warm temperature regime is a result of the milder
upstream Pacific air advancing east across the country, along with
a lack of any cold high pressure dropping south from Canada."

...Persistent periods of precipitation for the Pacific Northwest...

An occluded low pressure system is forecast to move northeastward
across the Great Lakes region and Northeast, then into
southeastern Canada late Sunday. This will bring continued rain
across coastal New England through Saturday night, some of which
could be locally heavy. Across the interior Northeast and the
Great Lakes, a mix of rain and snow is expected through Sunday
evening. Light snow is possible for the Central Appalachians as
well. Then on the backside of the low, lake enhancement of
snowfall could lead to snow amounts locally over 6 inches downwind
of the Lower Great Lakes through Monday. Freezing rain is also a
threat for northern Maine, where over a tenth of an inch of ice
could accumulate.

A series of upper-level disturbances and surface fronts will push
through the Northwest over the next couple of days, leading to
continued rounds of precipitation there. Lower elevation rain
(which could be locally heavy) and higher elevation snow are
forecast, with snowfall amounts in the Cascades well over a foot.
One frontal system should continue across the Great Basin toward
the Rockies Sunday night, spreading snow with it. 6 to 12 inches
of snow is forecast for the highest elevations of the Northern
Rockies and Wind River Mountains, with light snow into the
Intermountain West and Central Rockies through Monday.

Elsewhere, the Southern Plains to Lower Mississippi Valley can
expect showers and localized thunderstorms through Sunday morning,
spreading eastward to the Southeast and Tennessee Valley by Sunday
and Monday as a low pressure system moves across the Gulf of
Mexico. There is also a possibility of wintry weather in the high
elevations of the Southern/Central Appalachians by Monday morning.

Temperature-wise, warmer than average conditions can be expected
most everywhere, with the largest warm anomalies at 15 to 25
degrees above average for lows across the north-central U.S. to
the Northeast. Florida is one exception, where morning lows could
be cool Sunday morning, but temperatures rebound by Monday."

the next few days. Coastal ranges and valleys of the Pacific
Northwest will witness periods of rain day after day with rainfall
amounts averaging 1 to 2 inches. The higher elevations of the
region's coastal front could see rainfall totals in excess of 3
inches through Tuesday. In the Cascades of Washington and Oregon,
snow will pile up quickly with snow amounts being measured in feet
in the higher elevations. Pacific moisture associated with these
storms will spill east into the northern Rockies where valley
showers and mountain snow is also a good bet through Tuesday.

As the weekend storm system in the East tracks through Maine on
Sunday, snow showers and lake effect snow bands will stick around
across the Great Lakes, eastern Ohio Valley, and the central and
northern Appalachians through Tuesday. The heaviest snowfall will
be located downwind of Lakes Erie and Ontario where cumulative
amounts through Tuesday will range between 6 to 12 inches.
Downeast Maine will see locally heavy rainfall early Sunday
morning but drier conditions will quickly move in before midday,
although a few spotty rain or snow showers across central New
England cannot be ruled out.

Down south, a surface low pressure system will be responsible for
the development of scattered showers and thunderstorms from east
Texas and the Lower Mississippi Valley this morning, then across
the central Gulf Coast by this afternoon. While the thunderstorm
threat should diminish tonight, passing showers will continue
across the Deep South tonight and eventually reach the Southeast
by Monday. The best chance for thunderstorm activity on Monday
will reside across central and southern Florida. Some of the
southern Appalachians could even see a wintry mix develop Monday
morning. By Tuesday, an upper level disturbance in the Southwest
will spawn a new storm system in the southern Plains leading to
another round of showers and thunderstorms across the South
Central region."

Cascades should see snowfall amounts over a foot, and the Northern
Rockies and Wind River Mountains/Tetons may see snow approaching a
foot in the higher elevations.

As one upper-level disturbance continues southeastward from the
Pacific Northwest, precipitation will spread across the Great
Basin and Central/Southern Rockies through Monday morning, moving
into the High Plains by Monday evening as a low pressure system
consolidates. Rain showers are expected for most of Texas, but a
wintry mix of light snow and freezing rain is possible for the
Texas Panhandle and portions of Oklahoma northward into the
Central Plains Monday night into Tuesday. Snow and freezing rain
amounts will generally be light. Due to a couple cold fronts
associated with this low pressure system, high temperatures on
Tuesday could be more than 20 degrees colder than Monday across
Oklahoma and northern Texas.

Farther east, lake effect snow is expected to continue through
Monday night across the Lower Great Lakes region. Additionally,
the westerly flow will also cause upslope enhancement of snow for
higher elevations of the Central Appalachians and the Green
Mountains in particular. The Southeast could see rain showers
through Monday with some Gulf moisture, and parts of the Southern
Appalachians could experience a wintry mix Sunday night into

generally be light though a swath of snowfall accumulations of 2
to 6 inches, with locally higher amounts, are possible across
southwest Kansas and into the Oklahoma and north Texas Panhandles.
The storm will push through the Lower Mississippi Valley and Gulf
Coast Tuesday night with rain on the storm's southern flank and a
light wintry mix on its northern flank. By Wednesday, the wintry
hazards will diminish but areas of rain will continue across the
Southeast. Colder temperatures will funnel in behind the storm
with parts of southern and central Plains seeing daytime highs 10
to 20 degrees below normal by Thursday.

Elsewhere, favorable northwesterly flow across the still
relatively warm Great Lakes will generate lake effect snow showers
downwind of particularly Lakes Erie and Ontario through today with
an additional inch or two of snow accumulation possible. Snow
showers will finally dissipate Tuesday night as high pressure
builds in over the northeastern U.S. and eastern Canada. In the
northern Plains, warm air advecting into the region should bring
daytime highs 5 to 10 degrees above normal. While parts of the
Southern Plains will be chilly on Thursday, the contiguous U.S.
will remain void of any Arctic air-masses through the remainder of
the week."

...Unsettled weather continues across the Pacific Northwest to
much of the Rockies...

...A low pressure system expected to spread rain across the Deep
South and some wintry weather over the central Plains...


An active Pacific jet stream will continue to spread unsettled
weather into the Pacific Northwest across the Intermountain West
and then into many areas of the Rockies through Thursday.  The
westerly flow will bring relatively mild Pacific air across the
country for the next few days.  This will keep snow levels
relatively high in the mountains while rain is expected for the
lower elevations.  Snowfall amounts in excess of a foot can be
expected for the northern Cascades on Wednesday.

Further downstream across much of the rest of the country, a split
flow pattern will bring milder than normal temperatures across the
Northern Tier, while cooler than normal temperatures are expected
for the Deep South due to clouds and precipitation associated with
a low pressure system.  This system is currently gathering
strength over the southern Plains as a swath of showers spreads
eastward from the central Plains into the central Gulf states. 
Enough instability will lead to some thunderstorms near the Gulf
Coast.  Meanwhile, temperatures are cold enough for some snow to
fall over parts of the central Plains.  Snowfall amounts are
forecast to be light, with a couple of inches through Wednesday
morning.  By Wednesday night into Thursday, much of the rain is
expected to move across the eastern Gulf states as the low
pressure system is forecast to move relatively quickly east of
Florida, ending the rain there during Thursday morning. 
Meanwhile, light wintry precipitation is expected to spread
eastward across the northern Plains on Thursdays near and ahead of
a warm front.

Elsewhere, a stationary front lingering across the Great Lakes is
expected to bring light amounts of snowfall across the region
through Thursday."

...Developing Gulf of Mexico storm system to produce widespread
showers along the Gulf Coast late Thursday into Friday...

An active Pacific jet stream will continue to keep unsettled
weather in the forecast from the Pacific Northwest and
Intermountain West to the central and southern Rockies through
Friday. Along with the wet conditions, mild Pacific air will
traverse the western third of the country over the next few days.
This will keep snow levels relatively high in the mountains while
rain is expected for the lower elevations. Snowfall amounts in
excess of a foot can be expected for the northern Cascades today.

Further downstream across the rest of the country, a split flow
pattern will bring milder than normal temperatures across the
Northern Tier, while cooler than normal temperatures are expected
across the Southern Tier. The South's cooler temperature regime
the next few days is due to a pair of storm systems. The first
system will make its way through the Deep South today with rain
showers and a few thunderstorms passing through. A wintry mix may
occur at times in parts of the central Plains, Mid-South, and
southern Appalachians this morning with only light accumulations
expected. By tonight and into Thursday, much of the rain is
expected to move across the eastern Gulf states as the low
pressure system is forecast to move relatively quickly east of
Florida, ending the rain there during Thursday morning.

The second storm system to affect the Southern U.S. will come
together over northern Mexico Thursday morning then push into the
Gulf of Mexico Thursday night. Areas of showers will develop along
the western Gulf Coast late Thursday and blossom in coverage over
the central Gulf Coast by Friday morning. The shield of
precipitation will push across the Southeast later in the day
Friday leading to wet, dreary, and cool conditions region-wide."

An active Pacific jet stream will continue to keep unsettled
weather in the forecast for the Pacific Northwest through Friday. 
The most recent batch of moisture associated with a frontal system
is expected to spread eastward across the Intermountain West
tonight, and then across the northern Rockies and northern High
Plains on Thursday in the form light snow for the mountains and
areas of mixed precipitation for the lower elevations.  By
Thursday night into Friday, the next wave of moisture ahead of
another frontal system is expected to overspread the Pacific
Northwest once again with moderate to heavy snow over the northern
Cascades, while moderate to heavy rain is expected for the lower
elevations down to the immediate coasts.  Meanwhile, scattered
light snow and mixed precipitation is expected to move into the
upper Midwest.

Further south, a low pressure system centered near the eastern
Gulf Coast is forecast to bring rain across much of the
southeastern U.S including Florida through tonight.  This system
is expected to move relatively quickly eastward out into the
Atlantic, ending much of the rain across the Southeast by Thursday
afternoon.  Temperature-wise, milder than normal conditions are

An active Pacific jet stream will continue to keep unsettled
weather in the forecast for the Pacific Northwest into the
weekend. A brief area of high pressure overhead will keep the
region dry much of today, but by Thursday evening into Friday the
next round of moisture ahead of another storm system is expected
to overspread the Pacific Northwest. Expect moderate to heavy snow
over the northern Cascades and periods of moderate to heavy
rainfall in the valleys and coastal areas.  Farther east,
scattered light snow showers and mixed precipitation will pass
through the Midwest Thursday night and into Friday.

Further south, a low pressure system is producing scattered
showers over the coastal Southeast early this morning but showers
should taper off by late morning. As the aforementioned low
pressure system departs this morning, an upper-level trough over
northern Mexico will develop another wave of low pressure along a
front near the Gulf Coast Thursday night and into Friday morning.
Showers along the western Gulf Coast Thursday night will quickly
increase in coverage eastward through the rest of the Deep South

possible over the South Florida on Friday. The storm will reach
the Southeast coast by Friday night, then be positioned east of
the North Carolina Outer Banks by Saturday morning. Rain showers
along the Virginia and Southeast coast will lead to a wet Saturday
morning in these areas before drier conditions arrive by Saturday
afternoon.

Temperature-wise, aside from some a few cold spots in the
Northeast and Southern Plains this morning, milder than normal

After a break in the precipitation activity today, the Pacific
Northwest will be in for another wave of moisture arriving from
the Pacific on Friday.  Rain is expected to become heavy across
much of the Olympic Peninsula by Friday morning ahead of an
energetic frontal system.  The moisture will quickly penetrate
further inland, leading to mountain snows through much of the
northern Rockies on Friday.  Meanwhile, the active Pacific jet
stream will push the next wave of moisture toward the Pacific
Northwest before the region has a chance to dry out.  The low
pressure system associated with this wave of moisture will appear
to be more energetic than the previous one, as it will drag a
rather strong cold front through the Pacific Northwest on
Saturday.  Expect moderate to heavy snow over the northern
Cascades and periods of moderate to heavy rainfall to continue in
the valleys and coastal areas.  Potential exists for more than 5
inches of rain over parts of the Olympic Peninsula, and a couple
of feet of snow in the higher elevations of the northern Cascades
through Saturday.  More mountain snows will then spread farther
east into the northern Rockies on Saturday.

Farther east, scattered light snow showers and mixed precipitation
associated with a weak low pressure system are forecast to spread
across the northern Plains on Friday, before gradually taper off
over the Midwest on Saturday.  Meanwhile, snow showers associated
with an upper-level disturbance are expected to spread across the
Great Lakes on Saturday.

Further south, a subtropical jet from the eastern Pacific will
head across Mexico and interact with a frontal system and moisture
in the western Gulf on Friday.  This will give rise to formation
of a low pressure system over the northern Gulf later on Friday. 
Showers along the western Gulf Coast will quickly increase in
coverage eastward through the rest of the Deep South and the
Southeast on Friday leading to wet, dreary, and cool conditions
region-wide. In addition, some thunderstorms are possible over the
South Florida on Friday. The storm will reach the Southeast coast
by Friday night, then be positioned east of the North Carolina
Outer Banks by Saturday morning. Rain showers along the Virginia
and Southeast coast will lead to a wet Saturday morning in these
areas before drier conditions arrive by Saturday afternoon.

Temperature-wise, aside from some a few cold spots in the
Northeast and Southern Plains this morning, milder than normal

...Heavy rain returns to the Pacific Northwest and a coastal
surface low brushes by the East Coast...

An extended period of heavy rain is expected for northwestern
Oregon and especially western Washington on Friday as an
atmospheric river advects copious moisture inland ahead of a cold
front.  The Olympic mountains and the windward side of the
Cascades will take the brunt of the heaviest rain with totals in
the 2 to 4 inch range likely, with some locally higher amounts
possible.  Given the high snow levels ahead of the front, there
will likely be snow melt across existing snow pack that may
aggravate runoff and potential flooding concerns, and flood
watches are in effect for much of western Washington. 

A surface low developing over the northern Gulf of Mexico and
Florida, in combination with a stationary front off the Southeast
U.S. coast, will result in rain from the central Gulf Coast to the
DelMarVa Peninsula through early Saturday.  In addition, some
thunderstorms are possible across South Florida on Friday.  The
paucity of arctic air in place and an eventual surface low track
well off the East Coast and away from New England will greatly
reduce the threat of any significant winter weather from this
event.

Elsewhere across the continental U.S., some light wintry
precipitation is likely across the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes
region on Friday as a weakening disturbance passes through, and
should not amount to more than a nuisance.  Dry conditions will
continue from California to the High Plains in most cases as high
pressures governs the overall weather pattern."

...Heavy precipitation expected to impact the Pacific Northwest
through Saturday morning...

...Unsettled weather along the East Coast should taper off on
Sunday...

Copious moisture from the eastern Pacific is currently bringing
periods of heavy precipitation across northwestern Oregon and
especially western Washington ahead of an energetic cold front. 
Rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches over the lower elevations
together with more than a foot of snow over the higher elevations
of the northern Cascades are expected through Saturday before
drier air ushers in behind the cold front.  Given the high snow
levels ahead of the front, there will likely be snow melt across
existing snow pack that may aggravate runoff and potential
flooding concerns.  In addition to the heavy rain, winds will be
quite strong ahead of and just after the passage of the cold
front.  The front is forecast to push southeastward steadily
across the western U.S. through the weekend.  A period of snow can
be expected near and just after the passage of the cold front
across the Great Basin, Intermountain West, and the northern
Rockies on Sunday.

Meanwhile, unsettled weather is quickly spreading across the
southeastern U.S. as a couple of low pressure systems develop
along a front over the eastern Gulf of Mexico and just off the
Southeast U.S. coast.  The low off the Southeast U.S. is forecast
to become the main storm center tonight before moving off the
Mid-Atlantic coast on Saturday.  Rain is expected to spread across
the Carolinas into Virginia tonight before moving out to sea on
Saturday.  Some light wintry precipitation is also expected
farther north across New York and Pennsylvania.  Across the Great
Lakes, periods of light mixed precipitation are expected through
the weekend as an upper-level disturbance and a warm front
approach.

Elsewhere across the continental U.S., dry conditions will
continue for much of  California to the High Plains as a high
pressure system governs the overall weather pattern. 
Temperature-wise, much warmer than normal conditions are expected
for the central High Plains especially on Sunday as afternoon
highs climbing into the mid-70s would challenge daily records.  In
contrast, much colder air will filter across the Northwest behind
the cold front."

A surge of deep Pacific moisture ahead of a cold front will bring
heavy rain to western Washington and Oregon, with falling snow
levels to follow by Saturday night and thus heavy snow for the
Cascades this weekend.  Strong winds are also expected near the
coast with wind gusts in excess of 40 mph likely through early
Saturday.  As this storm system advances farther inland across the
Intermountain West, heavy snow is expected for the northern
Rockies on Sunday and reaching Utah and much of Wyoming by early
Monday.  Winter storm watches are already in effect for much of
Utah, Wyoming, and southern Montana, with 1 to 2 feet of snow for
the highest mountain ranges.

Surface cyclogenesis along a frontal boundary off the East Coast
will continue through Saturday, with rain tapering off for coastal
areas of the Mid-Atlantic and North Carolina through early
Saturday morning.  With the eventual track of the low expected to
remain well east of the coast through Sunday, the vast majority of
the precipitation from this storm will remain over the offshore
waters.  Heavy rain and some thunderstorms are likely to continue
across South Florida through Saturday as the cold front slowly
crosses the region.

Elsewhere across the continental U.S., dry conditions will
continue from the Desert Southwest to the Mississippi River Valley
as a high pressure system governs the overall weather pattern. 
Warmer than normal temperatures are expected for the central High

...Storm system continues to organize across the central and
southern Plains...

A powerful low pressure system currently over Texas will continue
to make weather headlines going through the middle of the week. 
This is in response to a big dip in the jet stream along with a
potent shortwave approaching from the Rockies and then crossing
the south-central states.  The result at the surface will be a
strong cold front with a deep surge of moisture from the Gulf of
Mexico ahead of it, fueling multiple rounds of heavy rain and
thunderstorms, especially from the central Gulf Coast to the Ohio
Valley and central Appalachians.  Rainfall totals through Thursday
morning could be on the order of 2 to 4 inches across portions of
Kentucky and Tennessee.  Severe weather could also be a problem
from Louisiana to Alabama, where the Storm Prediction Center is
indicating a slight risk of severe thunderstorms on Wednesday.

Given the strong temperature contrast to the northwest of the
surface low, a band of significant snowfall is becoming
increasingly likely from west-central Texas to central Oklahoma,
where winter storm watches are currently in effect.  The potential
exists for 4 to 8 inches of snow for some of these areas by
Wednesday night.  Lighter snow is expected farther north across
the southern Great Lakes and into New England, and some freezing
rain is likely across parts of the Ohio Valley and into
Pennsylvania. 

Elsewhere across the nation, additional heavy snow can be expected
for the Cascades and northern Rockies as a plume of moisture moves
inland from the Pacific.  There will be another day of mild
temperatures for the Mid-Atlantic region on Tuesday before a cold
front brings a return to reality by Wednesday, although warm
weather will continue farther south across the Southeast and into
Florida.  Dry conditions will continue across the Southwest and
the Upper Midwest."

...A low pressure system is expected to bring heavy rain across
the Southeast and a long stretch of wintry weather from the
southern Plains to the interior Northeast...

A deep upper-level trough interacting with a sharp front will
result in the formation of a low pressure system which will bring
increasingly heavy and widespread precipitation through the
eastern U.S. during the next few days.  Deep moisture from the
Gulf of Mexico is already gathering across the Deep South ahead of
the upper trough to the south of the sharp front that dissects the
southern Plains through the Northeast.  A low pressure system is
forecast to become consolidated over southern Texas by Wednesday
morning and then moves rapidly northeast toward the Eastern
Seaboard on Thursday.  Scattered showers and some thunderstorms in
the Deep South are expected to become more numerous as the day
progresses on Wednesday ahead of a strong cold front, where
thunderstorms could become severe from Louisiana to Alabama.  The
rain is expected to be most intense immediately ahead of the front
and near the track of the low center.  Rainfall totals through
Thursday night could be on the order of 2 to 4 inches across
portions of Kentucky, Tennessee, and into the southern
Appalachians.

The effects of this system will be far-reaching.  Cold air behind
the front will result in a long stretch of wintry precipitation
that impacts areas from the southern Plains through the interior
Northeast into Thursday night.  The highest amounts of wintry
precipitation are expected across northern New England where a
foot of snow is possible near the Canadian border.  Lighter
snowfall of 6 inches or less is expected farther to the southwest
across the lower Great Lakes through the Mid-Mississippi Valley
and into the southern Plains. 

Over the western U.S., additional couple of feet of heavy snow is
possible for the Cascades and northern Rockies as a plume of

...Storm system continues to organize across the Gulf Coast
region...

A powerful low pressure system currently near the western Gulf
Coast will continue to make weather headlines going through the
middle to end of the week.  This is in response to a big dip in
the jet stream along with a potent shortwave crossing Texas and
then over the Gulf Coast.  The result at the surface will be a
strong cold front with a deep surge of moisture from the Gulf of
Mexico ahead of it, fueling multiple rounds of heavy rain and
thunderstorms, especially from the central Gulf Coast to the
southern Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic region.  Rainfall totals
through Friday morning are expected to be on the order of 2 to 4
inches from the Florida Panhandle to New Jersey, with isolated 4
to 6 inch amounts possible.  A moderate risk of excessive rainfall
exists across western North Carolina and southern Virginia where
the potential for flooding is greatest.  There is a slight to
enhanced risk of severe thunderstorms as well from the central
Gulf Coast to the Carolinas through Thursday as instability and
wind shear parameters increase.

There is also a winter facet to this storm system as well from
western Texas to the Great Lakes, and eventually northern New
England.  This is a rather significant winter storm for
northwestern Texas, with 4 to 8 inches of snow likely through
Wednesday evening.   Winter storm warnings are in effect from
eastern New Mexico to the greater St. Louis metro area.  Some
freezing rain is likely across parts of the Ohio Valley and into
interior portions of the Northeast U.S. through Thursday night.

Elsewhere across the nation, additional heavy snow can be expected
for the Cascades and northern Rockies as a plume of moisture moves
inland from the Pacific.  Mild weather will continue across the
Southeast states ahead of the front, while colder temperatures
return to the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast..  Dry conditions will
continue across the Southwest and California."

...Strengthening Southeastern U.S. storm system to produce heavy
rainfall and the potential for flooding and severe weather, in
addition to disruptive snow and ice accumulations...

...Copious amounts of snow to blanket the higher elevations of the
Pacific Northwest and the Intermountain West, localized valley
flooding possible...

An organizing storm system in the Deep South will be responsible
for producing a myriad of weather hazards across much of the
eastern U.S. the next few days. A fetch of rich moisture from the
Gulf of Mexico will stream out ahead of an upper-level trough.
This will lead to developing areas of rain across the Mid-Atlantic
and scattered thunderstorms in the Southeast today and tomorrow.
Flood Watches and Flash Flood Watches are in effect from the
central Gulf Coast and the Southeast to the central Appalachians.
Heavy showers and thunderstorms will train across parts of these
areas tonight and Thursday leading to excessive rainfall total
ranging between 3 to 5 inches in these areas. Locally higher
amounts in excess of 5 inches are possible. In response, Moderate
risks for flash flooding have been issued in the Tennessee Valley
tonight and over the western Carolinas and southern Virginia
Piedmont on Thursday. Passing showers will be common along the
Mid-Atlantic and Northeast coasts tonight and lasting into Friday
morning. Farther south, severe weather may develop in parts of the
Deep South this afternoon and evening where a Tornado Watch is
currently in effect in the Lower Mississippi Valley. Severe
thunderstorms are expected to form across the Southeast again on
Thursday where an Enhanced risk for severe weather is in place.

Switching to the winter weather related impacts, as the ongoing
winter storm winds down in the Southern Plains this afternoon,
snow and an icy wintry mix will lead to treacherous travel
conditions in parts of the Midwest and Lower Great Lakes this
evening. Winter Storm Warnings stretch from north Texas and
central Oklahoma to the St. Louis metro area. Look for snow and an
icy mix of sleet and freezing rain to overspread the Great Lakes
and the interior Northeast tonight and into Thursday where Winter
Weather Advisories are in place. As the storm rapidly intensifies
Thursday night and into Friday, heavy snow will commence across
northern New England while a wintry mix causes slick spots in
portions of central New England.

In the West, additional heavy snow can be expected for the
Cascades and the northern and central Rockies as a plume of
Pacific moisture moves inland from the Pacific. Snowfall will be
measured in feet across the highest elevations. Meanwhile, the
lower elevations can expect periods of rain and potential
flooding, especially in areas surrounding the Seattle metro area
where Flood Watches are in effect into the day on Friday."

...Strong storm system across the eastern U.S. and heavy snow
returns to the Rockies...

A strong low pressure system currently over the Deep South and
across the Appalachians is producing a variety of weather impacts
across the eastern U.S. to end the work week.  This is in response
to a big dip in the jet stream over the Plains with a potent
shortwave crossing the Gulf Coast region.  Widespread heavy rain
and strong thunderstorms have developed in the warm sector from
Louisiana to the southern Appalachians, and this is forecast to
persist through Thursday night as the axis of heavy rain slowly
progresses eastward.  Rainfall totals through Friday night are
expected to be on the order of 1 to 3 inches from the Florida
Panhandle to southern Virginia, with isolated 4 inch amounts
possible.  Flash flood watches are in effect for many of these
areas.  There is an enhanced risk of severe thunderstorms as well
from northern Florida to the Carolinas through Thursday as
instability and wind shear parameters increase ahead of the cold
front.

There is also a winter facet to this storm system across the
southern Great Lakes and extending eastward to northern New
England.  The heaviest snow is predicted to fall from northern New
York to northern Maine, where the potential exists for up to a
foot or more of accumulation by Friday evening, and winter storm
warnings are in effect for these areas.  Icing will also be
problematic from central Pennsylvania to southern Maine where a
shallow layer of sub-freezing temperatures near the ground exists.


Elsewhere across the nation, additional heavy snow can be expected
for the Cascades and northern Rockies as a plume of moisture moves
inland from the Pacific.  Snowfall totals in the 1 to 2 foot range
appear likely for some of the highest mountain ranges.  Dry
conditions can be expected from California to the southern Plains
in the wake of the storm."

A strong low pressure system currently over the Central
Appalachians will move northeastward to over the Western Atlantic
off of Southeastern Canadian Coast by Saturday.  The system will
focus rain and convection over the Southeast with the WPC has
issued a moderate risk of excessive rainfall due to expecting
numerous flash flooding events.  In addition, many streams may
flood, potentially affecting larger rivers through Friday morning.
Likewise, the SPC has issued an enhanced risk of severe
thunderstorms over parts of the Southeast through Friday morning
as well.  Winter weather will accompany the storm over the
Northeast with heavy snow over parts of the Lower Great Lakes into
Northern New England and rain/freezing rain over the area near the
rain/snow line.  The winter weather will produce hazardous driving
conditions over the region. 

A second area of low pressure over the Upper Midwest will move
southeastward to the Ohio Valley by Saturday evening.  The system
will produce snow over parts of the Upper Midwest into the
Norther/Central Rockies that will southeastward into the Ohio
Valley by Saturday.  The snow will move into the Central
Appalachians overnight Saturday. 

Onshore flow and upper-level energy will aid in producing rain
over parts of the Pacific Northwest and snow over the Northern

...Heavy snow and freezing rain will continue for the interior
Northeast today...

...Precipitation continues for the Northwest before drying out by
Sunday...

A surface low pressure system is expected to consolidate and
strengthen rapidly in the Mid-Atlantic moving into the Northeast
today. This low and the strong jet stream will lead to heavy snow
of over a foot for northern New York and New England north and
west of the low. Just to the south, an area of freezing rain is
expected for parts of north-central Pennsylvania and central New
York, with heavier ice amounts over a tenth of an inch forecast
for southern Vermont and New Hampshire as well as along the coast
of Maine. Potentially record-setting above average temperatures
will keep precipitation in the form of rain closer to the Atlantic
coast of New York and southern New England. Wind Advisories are
widespread along the Eastern Seaboard since breezy winds are
expected behind the cold fronts associated with the low. On
another note, this low could set low pressure records for the
month of February in portions of the northern Mid-Atlantic to
Northeast. The low should move quickly out of the U.S. tonight,
but some lighter snow could continue via lake enhancement in the
Lower Great Lakes region and via upslope flow in the Central
Appalachians. A weaker low pressure system will spread light snows
across the Midwest to Ohio Valley and Upper Great Lakes today, and
then lead to another possible round of light snow for the
Appalachians and parts of the Mid-Atlantic Saturday into Sunday.

In the West, a low pressure system will move southeastward into
British Columbia today and then into the Northern High Plains by
Saturday morning. Another round of precipitation is expected with
this frontal system, with rain in the lowest elevations and heavy
snow in higher elevations. The Cascades and the Northern/Central
Rockies should see snowfall over a foot with this system. As the
low ejects into the Plains, light to moderate snow will spread
across the Northern Plains into the Upper Midwest on Saturday and
Saturday night. Meanwhile, the Northwest gets a much-needed break
from precipitation early next week as ridging builds into the area."

A cold front is forecast to move across the Plains, Mississippi
Valley, and Ohio Valley over the next couple of days. Copious
amounts of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico will flow into these
areas along and ahead of the front, and with a strong jet stream
overhead, conditions will be right for heavy rain. Rain and some
thunderstorms will develop today across the Lower Mississippi
Valley into the Ohio Valley, with some rainfall amounts above an
inch. However, the heaviest rain (3 to 5 inches, with locally
higher amounts possible) is expected on Monday as the front moves
southeastward more slowly, leading to training (cells repeating
over the same area). Thus, a Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall
is in place on Monday and Monday night for eastern portions of the
Lower Mississippi Valley eastward into southern parts of the
Tennessee Valley, northern parts of the Southeast, and into the
Southern Appalachians. Much of this area has seen above average
rainfall and even some flooding lately, compounding the risk of
flash flooding.

Farther north, the low associated with the cold front will track
eastward across the Upper Midwest and across the Great Lakes
region today and tonight, and snow is expected to its north and
east. A swath of 6 to 12 inches of snow is forecast for
southeastern Minnesota through much of Wisconsin and into western
Michigan, and Winter Storm Warnings are in effect for those areas.
Snow should then spread into the Northeast tonight, with light to
moderate amounts expected, locally as high as 6 inches especially
in higher terrain.

Elsewhere, the back end of the cold front is forecast to move
slowly through the Southwest today and tomorrow, leading to rain
showers and snow for higher elevations along and behind the front.
The Central and Southern Rockies should see snow totals of 6 to 12
inches, with higher amounts in the highest peaks. The Mogollon Rim
can expect a few inches of snow, and lower elevations could see
light snow even into the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles. The cold

Prediction Center.  These thunderstorms will have ample moisture
and capability of continuing very heavy rainfall and flooding
conditions across the Lower Mississippi Valley into the Tennessee
Valley. With the potential of 2 to 3 inches of rain over highly
saturated areas; the Weather Prediction Center has upgraded to a
Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall from Central Tennessee into
south-central Kentucky with a Slight Risk extending into the Upper
Ohio Valley and Cumberland Plateau.  Extensive Flash Flood Watches
have been issued by the majority of the forecast areas described
above from eastern TX to southern Ohio/West Virginia. 

By Thursday morning, the surface low will have quickly progressed
into the Upper Ohio Valley/Allegheny Plateau with the cold front
pressing through the Appalachian mountains.  Further north, an
Arctic air mass will have dropped south across the Northern Plains
with temperatures about 10-20 degrees below average behind the
front reaching into the Upper Midwest by Thursday morning.  The
combination of the moisture drawn out of the Gulf ahead of the
front and approaching colder air from the north will support the
threat for light to occasionally moderate snows north of the front
in IND, OH, PA and New York, with some mixing and potential for
freezing rain conditions.  Temperatures behind the Arctic cold
front will expand across the Upper Midwest and into the Western
Great Lakes by the end of the forecast period (Thursday night)

received rainfall in the past 1 to 2  weeks. With pooled Gulf
moisture interacting with a slow moving front from the western
Gulf Coast to the Mid-Atlantic, moderate to heavy rain will
persist across the South. A surface low pressure is expected to
develop today (Wednesday) and deepen across the eastern coast of
Texas into western Tennessee. By Thursday morning, the surface low

Plateau with the cold front pressing through the Appalachian
mountains. WPC has a Moderate Risk for excessive rainfall in
effect from northeast Mississippi to south-central Kentucky
through Thursday. However, ample rain across the Gulf states into
the Tennessee Valley and Appalachian region will persist through
the end of the week. In addition to the flooding threat, the Storm
Prediction Center has highlighted much of Mississippi to eastern
Tennessee as having a Slight Risk for strong to severe
thunderstorm development.

An Arctic airmass will surge south through the Northern Plains and
Upper Mississippi Valley, allowing temperatures to fall 10 to 20
degrees below average in the wake of the frontal passage. The
combination of the moisture drawn out of the Gulf ahead of the

A surface cyclone had developed across Louisiana and is expected
to strengthen as it slides northeast into the Tennessee Valley
tonight and through the Upper Ohio River Valley early tomorrow. 
Along and ahead of the surface low, deep Gulf moisture will be
available for thunderstorms capable of producing isolated
tornadoes and severe winds across MS into northern Alabama and the
Storm Prediction Center has issued a Slight Risk for severe
weather to account for such.  Additionally, these storms have a
potential for 2 to 3 inches of rainfall which has lead to Weather
Prediction Center issuing a Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall
across much of the same area into the Cumberland Plateau.  In
combination with saturated soils over the last few weeks, flooding
is likely with some potential for flash flooding conditions
tonight into early Thursday morning with much of the area from
northeast Texas to West Virginia and Southern Ohio/Indiana to
central Alabama/Mississippi under flash flooding watches. 

North of the front, cooler air across the northern Ohio River
Valley into the central Hudson River Valley allow for remaining
moisture to convert into light to moderate snow fall with the
potential of 3 to 6 inches of snow from N Missouri to the Lower
Great Lakes, with freezing rain and mixed wintry precipitation
south of the snow, across Central IND, OH into PA and then into
Central New England by Thursday. The storm will weaken over the
Allegheny Plateau and transfer to a developing coastal low that
will help press the moisture/rainfall offshore with lingering
showers across the Southeast into Florida at the tail end of the
front by Friday morning.

An Arctic cold front is already progressing through the Northern
Plains and Upper Midwest, and will continue to drop south and east
bringing cold and drier conditions in its wake.  Temperatures will
be about 10-20 degrees below average from the Northern and Central
Plains tomorrow (Thursday) and into the Ohio Valley and Interior
New England/Lower Great Lakes by Friday.  The cold surge does drop
temperatures below normal across the Southern Plains, but only
about 5-10 degrees as the coldest air is directed more east and
south by later Thursday.

The active train of storms across the Gulf of Alaska will slowly
drift south and start to affect the Pacific Northwest by early
Thursday. This will bring increased moisture into the orographic
areas of the Olympic and northern Cascade Ranges.  Lower
elevations will see moderate rainfall but significant higher
elevation snows are expected late Thursday into Friday with over 1

northern New England by Saturday morning.

Meanwhile, a series of low pressure systems and upper-level
troughs are expected to track across the Pacific Northwest toward
the northern Rockies for the next couple of days.  This will keep
a good chance of precipitation across the region through Saturday.
 The higher elevations will likely see heavy accumulations of wet
snow especially later on Saturday.  A piece of the energy from
this system is forecast to eject eastward across the northern

system develops.  The heaviest snow is forecast from central
Wisconsin through the central Great Lakes where more than 6 inches
of total accumulations are possible before the low moves eastward
into New England on Tuesday.

showers are continuing across the northern and central Rockies as
well as the nearby High Plains.  As a high pressure system
associated with the cold air mass pushes southward, the chance of
snow is expected to increase over Colorado on Wednesday due to the
increase of upslope flow from the northeast across the region.

Aside from the rainfall threat with the front in the near-term,
there will also be a wave of low pressure developing along the
same front as it moves offshore of North Carolina by late

Friday across the Northern Plains into the Upper Mississippi
Valley.  This warming trend is then expected to push eastward by
the weekend across the Great Lakes and into the Northeast.

The broad region of cold air will support accumulating snows
Wednesday into early Thursday from the lee of the Central Rockies
into the Central Plains.  Accumulating snow potential is also
possible late Thursday into early Friday from the Southern
Appalachians, eastward across much of North Carolina, northern
South Carolina and southern Virginia.

Dry weather will persist across much of western U.S. from the west
coast into the Great Basin and Northern Rockies.  Temperatures are
expected to be above average from the Southwest, southern Great
Basin and along all of the west coast."

Soils remain saturated across portions of the South from recent
heavy rains with ongoing major to historic river flooding. While
precipitation coverage and intensities are expected to decrease
today across the South, another round of precipitation is expected
to push eastward from the southern Plains tonight and move east
across the Gulf Coast states and Southeast on Thursday. Additional
moderate to heavy rainfall is expected across these areas,
exacerbating the ongoing significant river flooding across areas
of the South.

Meanwhile, a broad region of Arctic high pressure pushing down
across the north-central U.S. today will spread east-southeastward
and encompass much of the central to eastern U.S. going through
Thursday. This high will keep temperatures below average for this
part of the country, with exception to central and south Florida
where above average temperatures will persist through the balance
of the week. Overall, the cold spell will be brief with
temperatures beginning to rebound to above average levels by
Friday across the northern Plains and Upper Midwest. This warming
trend will then translate eastward this weekend across the Great
Lakes and Northeast.

In the short-term, the cold air filtering south will support
accumulating snowfall through early Thursday from the lee of the
central Rockies and over the central High Plains. Accumulating
snow is also now likely late Thursday through early Friday from
the southern Appalachians, eastward across much of North Carolina,
northern South Carolina and southern Virginia where locally
several inches of snow is expected.

Elsewhere, dry weather will persist across much of western U.S.
from the West Coast into the Great Basin and the northern Rockies.
Temperatures are expected to be somewhat warmer than normal along
the West Coast and into the Great Basin through Friday. However,
there will be a weak area of low pressure coming into the

...Periods of rain and potential flash flooding over the Southeast
this afternoon...

...Snow in portions of the Carolinas and Southern Appalachians,
chilly temperatures to follow ...

...Exceptionally dry Friday, wet and wintry weather arrives in the
Southwest this weekend...

An area of low pressure tracking along a frontal boundary draped
over the coastal southeastern U.S. is responsible for a pair of
weather hazards over the Southeast this afternoon and evening.
First, rain continues to fall throughout much of the Southeast
this afternoon. Soil moisture remains overly saturated and rivers
and streams are high in portions of the Southeast, thus making
flash flooding a concern through Thursday evening. As a result,
Flash Flood Watches have been issued for portions of central
Alabama and central Georgia where the heaviest rainfall rates are
expected to occur through this evening.

Second, sub-freezing temperatures are spilling in from the north
causing precipitation to fall as snow in portions of the Tennessee
Valley and the Southern Appalachians this afternoon. As the storm
intensifies off the Carolina coast this evening, rain will
changeover to snow in southeast Virginia, central and eastern
North Carolina, and the Appalachians of South Carolina and
northern Georgia. The heaviest snowfall will be located over
east-central North Carolina and southeast Virginia where 3 to 6
inches of snow is expected. Locally higher totals in excess of 6
inches are possible. Drier conditions will return once the storm
tracks into the heart of the northwest Atlantic Friday morning,
but well below normal temperatures will engulf much of the south
on Friday and persist into Saturday as a dome of Arctic high
pressure takes control.

Speaking of high pressure, the affects from this massive dome of
high pressure will be felt from coast to coast Friday morning with
very little precipitation in the forecast much of the day.
Precipitation will be on the increase over the Southwest Friday
night as an upper-level trough approaches from the west. By
Saturday the upper level trough, tapping into subtropical moisture
from the East Pacific, will advance through the Southwest region
with widespread showers and even a few thunderstorms possible in
the desert regions. Precipitation is welcomed in parched areas of
the Four Corners region but some localized totals in excess of an
inch could lead to flash flooding concerns in south-central
Arizona. Meanwhile, mountain snow is likely to develop from the
Sierra Nevada and the Great Basin to the Wasatch on Saturday. Snow
will then reach the Colorado Rockies by Saturday night and
continue into the day on Sunday."

...Snow and sleet ending this morning across portions of the
Carolinas...

...Cold weather across the eastern two-thirds of the country will
gradually moderate...

...A storm system is expected to spread mountain snows and areas
of heavy rain across the Southwest this weekend...

The weather across much of the U.S. will quiet down for the time
being today as a large dome of cold high pressure system
dominates.  Portions of the Carolinas will wake up with a couple
inches of snow this morning as an area of low pressure moves
rapidly out into the Atlantic.  Some sleet and/or mixed
precipitation can also be expected farther south before ending
early in the morning.

A large dome of high pressure system behind the departing storm
will bring a brief period of quiet weather for much of the country
this afternoon.  This high pressure system will keep chilly
conditions for much of the South and into the Mid-Atlantic through
the weekend.  Meanwhile, milder air will return across the
Southwest as well as the northern Plains.

By the weekend, unsettled weather will quickly move into the
Desert Southwest as a low pressure system currently developing
over the eastern Pacific moves onshore.  It appears that this
system will deliver a decent amount of wet snow for the higher
elevations of the Southwest through the central Rockies this
weekend.  For the lower elevations,  widespread rain and even some
thunderstorms can be expected.  Although precipitation is welcomed
in the parched areas of the Four Corners region, localized
rainfall totals in excess of an inch could lead to flash flooding
concerns in south-central Arizona.  Meanwhile, mountain snow is
likely to develop from the Sierra Nevada and the Great Basin to
the Wasatch on Saturday. Snow will then reach the Colorado Rockies
by Saturday night and continue into the day on Sunday.  Rain will
also develop quickly over the central Plains Sunday morning as the
low pressure system consolidates over the central High Plains."

Central Rockies/Plains on Sunday...

...Rain and mountain snow return to the Northwest on Sunday ...

The Lower 48 will continue to observe tranquil weather conditions
through this evening as a large dome of high pressure remains in
control. Chilly temperatures will be felt across the eastern half
of the country tonight and Saturday morning with the coldest
anomalies located in the Southeast. A few Freeze Warnings have
been issued for parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley and the
Southeast early Saturday morning. As high pressure slides eastward
throughout the weekend, winds will shift out of the south and
southwest over the Nation's Heartland, Great Lakes, and Northeast
leading to the return of milder temperatures.

The first in a pair of Pacific storm systems to impact the U.S.
arrives late tonight in the Southwest as a low pressure system
approaches the region. This storm system will tap into a source of
deep moisture originating from the subtropical Pacific and send
said moisture into the Southwest on Saturday. In response, rain
will develop across the Southwest with thunderstorms also possible
in portions of southern Arizona and New Mexico. The heaviest
rainfall looks to be concentrated in the higher elevations of
western New Mexico and south-central Arizona where rainfall totals
ranging between 1 and 2 inches is possible. A Slight Risk for
Excessive Rainfall has been issued for these areas due to heavy
rainfall rates potentially causing areas of flash flooding on
Saturday. By Sunday, this storm system will intensify in the
Central Plains generating areas of showers and a few
thunderstorms. Look for mountain snow to fall from the southern
Sierra Nevada and the Wasatch to the Colorado Rockies this weekend
as well.

Further north, a separate Pacific storm system will cause an
increase in showers and and mountain snow over the Pacific
Northwest on Sunday. The Olympics and Cascades will receive more
mountain snow while the valleys and coastal areas see rain. The
storm system will then track into the northern Rockies Sunday
night leading to more areas of mountain snow through Monday

After a day of tranquil conditions across much of the country on
Friday, unsettled weather is expected to move quickly into the
southwestern U.S. followed by the Pacific Northwest this weekend. 
A large high pressure system responsible for the tranquil weather
will gradually weaken and then slide off the East Coast during the
next few days.  Chilly conditions across the eastern half of the
country will gradually moderate to above normal levels by Monday
as winds shift to a more southerly direction.  Meanwhile, a low
pressure system that has been developing over the eastern Pacific
is taking aim at the southwestern U.S. This storm system will tap
into moisture originating deep from the tropical Pacific and begin
to spread rain into the Desert Southwest today with the
possibility of thunderstorms this afternoon and evening across
portions of Arizona and New Mexico. The heaviest rainfall looks to
be concentrated in the higher elevations of western New Mexico and
south-central Arizona where rainfall totals ranging between 1 and
2 inches is possible. A Slight Risk for Excessive Rainfall has
been issued for these areas due to heavy rainfall rates
potentially causing areas of flash flooding today.  In addition,
mountain snow is expected from the southern Sierra Nevada and the
Wasatch to the Colorado Rockies through this weekend.

By Sunday, this storm system is forecast to intensify as it moves
into the central High Plains.  Showers and some thunderstorms are
expected to quickly develop and expand across the central Plains
toward the Mid-Mississippi Valley through Sunday night. Some
wintry precipitation is also possible farther to the north from
across the central Plains into the upper Midwest and the lower
Great Lakes Sunday night into Monday morning.  The southern
Appalachians could also see wintry precipitation developing Monday
morning as thunderstorms will likely be moving across the lower to
mid-Mississippi Valley ahead of the intensifying storm.

Farther north, another low pressure system will cause an increase
in showers and and mountain snow over the Pacific Northwest on
Sunday. The Olympics and Cascades will receive more mountain snow
while the valleys and coastal areas see rain. The storm system
will then track into the northern Rockies Sunday night leading to
more areas of mountain snow.  The snow will then expand farther

southern Nevada, much of Arizona, and western New Mexico. Rainfall
totals between 1 to 2 inches with localized amounts exceeding 2
inches are likely as rich subtropical moisture streams overhead

Excessive Rainfall remains in place for south-central Arizona and
far western New Mexico where there is the potential for flash
flooding into Saturday evening. The higher elevations of the Four
Corners region can expect precipitation to fall in the form of
snow tonight and into Sunday. Winter Weather Advisories are in
effect from south-central Nevada to southern Utah and the Colorado
Rockies. Even a few locations in northern Arizona and New Mexico
can expect accumulating snowfall

By Sunday, the storm system is forecast to intensify as it moves
into the central High Plains. Showers and some thunderstorms will
quickly develop and expand across the central Plains toward the
Mid-Mississippi Valley through Sunday night. Some wintry
precipitation is also possible farther north stretching from the
central Plains and the Midwest into the lower Great Lakes Sunday
night into Monday morning. The southern and central Appalachians
could also witness wintry precipitation Monday morning. To the
south, thunderstorms will likely be moving across the lower to
mid-Mississippi Valley Sunday night then into the Southeast late
in the day on Monday ahead of the intensifying storm. Marginal
Risks for flash flooding have been issued for eastern Kansas and
southern Missouri on Sunday, as well as southern Georgia and the
Florida Panhandle on Monday.

Further north, another low pressure system will cause an increase
in showers and mountain snow over the Pacific Northwest on Sunday.
The Olympics and Cascades will receive more mountain snow while
the valleys and coastal areas see rain. The storm system will then
track into the northern Rockies Sunday night leading to more areas

as snow for the high elevations across the southern Great Basin.
The snow is expected to move across Colorado and portions of the
southern Rockies later today as the intensifying system reaches
the central High Plains.  Mild air surging northward from the Gulf
of Mexico will be lifted along a warm front.  This will result in
showers and some thunderstorms to quickly expand eastward across

the central Plains to the Midwest and into the lower Great Lakes
when colder air filters in from the north behind a cold front. As

An intensifying low pressure system has entered the southern High
Plains with showers stretching from eastern New Mexico to the
Mid-South. As the storm's cold front tracks east through Texas
this evening, there is the potential for scattered thunderstorms
ahead of the front across southern and central Plains with the
best chance for severe storms in the eastern Texas Panhandle and
western Oklahoma. Further north, the central Rockies will receive
accumulating snowfall through this evening with snow tapering off
over night. As the storm tracks east on Monday, so will the
showers and thunderstorms across the Gulf Coast states and into
the Ohio Valley. There is the potential for flash flooding Monday
evening in parts of the Southeast where some heavy showers and
thunderstorms are likely to produce locally heavy rainfall rates.
As the storm's warm front lifts northward Monday night and into
Tuesday, expect showers to reach the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast
Monday night and persist into Tuesday. A swath of wintry mix is
possible across northern New England Tuesday morning.

Speaking of wintry weather, the Midwest and central Great Lakes
will see an initially narrow area of wintry weather Monday morning
turn into a more pronounced band of moderate snow Monday night and
into Tuesday. As the storm intensifies Tuesday morning, heavy snow
will set up from the Midwest to the central Great Lakes. Snowfall
accumulations in these areas may range between 6 to 12 inches with
some locally higher totals possible. Winter Storm Watches have
been issued for portions of the Midwest ahead of this potential
winter storm. Along with the heavy snowfall, winds will pick up in
intensity along the northern and western flanks of the storm late
Tuesday into Tuesday night. This could lead to blustery conditions
and reduced visibilities in these areas. Expect snow and gusty
winds to continue across the Great Lakes into Wednesday while
colder and drier conditions filter down the backside of the storm
across the Midwest and into the South-Central U.S..

In the Northwest, a low pressure system is responsible for areas
of showers and mountain snow this afternoon. The Olympics and
Cascades will receive more mountain snow while the valleys and

A wide variety of weather is expected to occur across the mainland
U.S. into mid-week as a couple of significant atmospheric
disturbances converge and interact with one another over the
national's heartland.  First of all, an intensifying low pressure
system is bringing moderate to heavy rainfall across Nebraska into
Missouri this morning.  Potential exists for flooding to occur in
these areas today before the storm moves farther away toward the
eastern U.S. tonight.  Meanwhile, showers and possibly scattered
thunderstorms are expected to develop and expand eastward across
the Deep South into the Southeast today ahead of a cold front.  By
Monday night into Tuesday morning, the rain the expected to move
into many places across the Mid-Atlantic and down into the
Southeast.  Central New England can expect mixed precipitation to
arrive Tuesday morning, lasting into Wednesday morning.

Meanwhile, another low pressure system is getting organized over
the northern High Plains.  This system is expected to spread a
swath of snow rapidly across the northern Rockies eastward through
the northern Plains today, and will begin to interact with the
aforementioned low pressure system over the Ohio Valley tonight. 
This interaction will result in a swath of significant snowfall
across the Midwest into the lower to central Great Lakes by
Wednesday morning.  Snowfall accumulations in these areas may
range between 6 to 12 inches with some locally higher totals
possible. Winter Storm Watches have been issued for portions of
the Midwest ahead of this potential winter storm. Along with the
heavy snowfall, winds will pick up in intensity along the northern
and western flanks of the storm late Tuesday and should  reach
peak intensity by Wednesday morning. This would lead to blustery
conditions with reduced visibilities in these areas due to the
combination of snow and gusty winds.  Colder and drier air will
conditions filter down the backside of the storm down through much
of the Great Plains by Wednesday morning.

The mountain snow across the northwestern U.S. will gradually
taper off as a large surface high pressure system settles into the
region.  Much of the Southwest will be dry and warmer than normal.
 As the high pressure system begins to push southward, northerly
winds are expected to pick up across the Great Basin today behind
a dry cold front. By Tuesday night into Wednesday morning, gusty
Santa Ana winds could impact southern California as the dry front
passes through the region."

The mid to upper level pattern across the mid section of the
nation will undergo amplification over the next few days, setting
the stage for a very active weather pattern across large sections
of the nation.  Accumulating snows will develop initially over
portions of the Northern Plains Monday night into Tuesday and
farther east later Tuesday, continuing into Wednesday, from the
Mid West into the Great Lakes.  This will support a highly
impactful storm with snow totals of 4-8""+ across portions of the
Northern Plains and a heavier stripe of 6-12""+ snows from far
northeast Missouri, far southeast Iowa, across northern Illinois,
including the Chicago Metro area, into far northwest Indiana and
the southern portions of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan,
including the Detroit metro area.  Travel will be significantly
affected in these heavy snow areas, especially in the more
urbanized areas from the Mid West into the Great Lakes where
strengthening winds Tuesday into Wednesday will produce
considerable blowing and drifting of snow along with greatly
reduced visibilities.

On the southeastern peripheries of this storm system, a large
region of rain and thunderstorms are expected to push eastward
Monday evening into early Tuesday across portions of the South
into the Southeast.  This will result in heavy precipitation
potential and an isolated flooding threat, especially across
portions of south central Georgia where ongoing moderate river
flooding is already occurring.  The good news with this heavy
rains event is that it will be primarily to the east of portions
of Mississippi and Alabama that have experienced very heavy rains
and flooding recently. 

In the wake of the above mentioned developing snow storm from the
Northern Plains into the Great Lakes, much colder air will be
pushing southeastward from the Rockies and across the Plains and
Mississippi Valley Tuesday and Wednesday.  High temperatures
Tuesday will be 15 to 20 degrees below average through the Central
to Southern Rockies, eastward into the High Plains and 15 to 20
degrees below average on Wednesday across much of the Plains and
Lower to Middle Mississippi Valley.

Above to much above average temperatures expected across much of
the West coast and Great Basin Tuesday and Wednesday with high
temperatures expected to be 15-20 degrees above average.  Along
with the warm temperatures, increasing winds and low relative
humidities will increase the fire weather threat across portions
of southern California and western Arizona Tuesday into Wednesday.

The fire weather threat will also increase across portions of the
Southern High Plains from eastern to southern New Mexico into far
west and Southwest Texas from Monday afternoon through Tuesday. 
Winds across these areas are expected to increase with the passage
of a cold front this evening and remain strong through the day on
Tuesday.   This combined with lowering relative humidifies and
expected dry weather will increase the wild fire threat across
these areas."

In terms of rainfall potential, the majority of the heaviest
rainfall will have exited the coast by Tuesday morning, with some
lingering convection ahead of the front across north-central
Florida with perhaps one to two inches possible through Tuesday
night.  Multiple rounds of light to moderate rain are expected

...Snow across the Midwest today followed by heavy wet snow for
the northern New England on Thursday...

...Very heavy lake-effect snow event downwind from the lower Great
Lakes Thursday to Friday...

...Cold air across much of the Plains will spread eastward into
the East Coast on Thursday...

A broad low pressure system currently over the eastern U.S. is
bringing scattered areas of rain and drizzle for much of the East
Coast.  Meanwhile, snow associated with a broad upper-level trough
continues to spread across the mid-Mississippi Valley, the
Midwest, and into the lower Great Lakes.  These two systems are
forecast to interact with one other and merge along the East Coast
later today, resulting in a rapidly developing storm heading
across New England on Thursday.  Wet snow can be expected to
develop and become heavier over northern New England through today
as the intensifying storm approaches.  Meanwhile, snow across the
Midwest and the lower Great Lakes will gradually taper off as the
storm departs.

In terms of rainfall potential, the majority of the heaviest rain
should be found across Florida in association with a front. 
Farther north, scattered light rain and drizzle along the East
Coast is expected to expand and become heavy at times as the storm
rapidly intensifies.  The rain could change over to a period of
heavy wet snow across the central Appalachians Wednesday night
into Thursday morning before ending as the storm center moves away
toward New England.  Much cooler air will rush in behind the
intense storm on Thursday across the northeastern U.S. under
blustery west to northwesterly winds.

Elsewhere, dry conditions are forecast from the Intermountain West
to Texas, and also across the Upper Midwest where below normal
temperatures are expected.  A quick round of light snow and mixed
precipitation is likely from the northern Rockies to High Plains
on Thursday, rapidly moving eastward toward the Ohio Valley by
Friday morning as a clipper low pressure system moves across. Over
the Great Lakes, a major lake-effect snow is forecast to develop
downwind from the lower Great Lakes on Thursday where
accumulations of over one foot are possible.  Over the Southwest,
gusty Santa Ana winds today are expected to gradually subside on
Thursday."

Low pressure over the Northern Mid-Atlantic will move northward
into Southeastern Canada.  The system will produce an area of
light snow over parts of the Upper Great Lakes into the Ohio
Valley and parts of the Tennessee Valley and Middle Mississippi
Valley that will move into the Central Appalachians overnight
Wednesday and parts of Northern Mid-Atlantic and Northern New
England on Thursday.  Rain will also develop over parts of
Southern New England into parts of the Ohio Valley to parts of the
Central Gulf Coast on Wednesday evening. The rain over the
Southeast and Southern Mid-Atlantic will move off the coast by
Thursday morning.  The rain ends over New England by Thursday
afternoon.

In the wake of the storm, a major lake-effect snow event is
forecast to develop downwind from the Lower Great Lakes on
Thursday where accumulations of over one foot are possible.  In
addition, blizzard warning are posted over parts of Western New
York state downwind from Lake Erie and Lake Ontario.  Over the
Southwest, gusty Santa Ana winds today are expected to gradually

...Cold conditions expected to dominate the eastern half of the
country in contrast with milder than normal conditions in the
West...

A low pressure complex is currently consolidating and intensifying
over the northeastern U.S.  Rain associated with the trailing cold
front is moving off the East Coast into the Atlantic. However,
much of New England will remain under the influence of the strong
low pressure system for the next couple of days.  Moderate to
heavy rain is expected to overspread central New England this
morning as the storm center approaches. In addition, as the storm
intensifies further, winds will become very gusty, especially when
cold air rushes in from the back side of the system after the
storm center has passed by. Northern Maine should see all snow
through tonight, accumulating to over a foot in parts of the area
before gradually tapering off on Friday.

Over upstate/western New York, a major lake-effect snow event is
expected to begin today once the storm center passes east of the
area as cold and blustery westerly winds blow across the still
warm lake waters.  Over two feet of snow is possible downwind of
Lake Ontario through Friday morning.  Blizzard warnings are in
effect over parts of Western New York state downwind from Lake
Erie and Lake Ontario.  The snow should become less intense by
Friday as the storm edges slowly further into Canada.

Over the northern Rockies to the northern High Plains, a clipper
low
pressure system will bring a quick round of rain or mixed
precipitation across the central Plains through today, reaching
the central and southern Appalachians on Friday in the form of wet
snow, which may linger into Saturday morning.  Meanwhile, moisture
from the next Pacific system is forecast to reach the Pacific
Northwest later on Friday, and could reach the Intermountain West
as snow and snow showers by Friday night.

Temperatures will mainly be colder than average for the eastern
half of the country in contrast with warmer than average reading

...Snow spreads southward across the western U.S. along with
cooler temperatures...

...Rain and thunderstorm chances increase in the Mid-South Sunday
night and Monday...

An upper-level trough is forecast to drop south along the West
Coast through the short range period. This will bring increasing
chances of snow particularly for higher elevations in the West,
spreading north to south with the upper trough. Snowfall totals
are expected to be above 6 inches and potentially exceeding a foot
in the Sierra Nevada, the Wind River Mountains, Wasatch, and the
Central Rockies through Monday. Lighter snows are expected in the
Intermountain West and toward the Mogollon Rim. Below normal
temperatures will support these snow chances, with daytime highs
10 to 20 degrees below average in some areas. Meanwhile, the
Heartland can expect temperatures 10 to 20 degrees above normal,
just in time for the beginning of meteorological spring.

As the trough begins to pivot eastward, moisture from the Pacific
and from the Gulf of Mexico should begin to combine and lead to
rain and thunderstorms beginning Sunday night and continuing into
Monday. Through Monday, around an inch of rainfall is forecast for
much of the Tennessee Valley. However, this will just be the
start, as the heavy rain threat is forecast to extend into midweek
from the south-central to eastern U.S. Some rain is expected to
extend northward into the Ohio Valley toward the Appalachians on
Monday ahead of a cold front.

Elsewhere, light snow showers could continue in the Great Lakes
region overnight before winding down Sunday. But some light snow
could affect the interior Northeast once again on Monday on the
northern side of the precipitation shield. Additionally, another
front coming into the Northwest could bring another round of lower
elevation rain and higher elevation snow to that region by Monday."

Mississippi Valley and Deep South Sunday night and Monday...

...Spring like temperatures to engulf much of the eastern U.S....

An upper-level trough will track south along the West Coast Sunday
and across the southwestern U.S. the first half of the week. The
primary impact from this system will be snow, particularly across
the higher elevations in the West. Snowfall totals are forecast to
accumulate 6 inches with potentially exceeding a foot in the
Sierra Nevada, the Wind River Mountains, Wasatch, and the Central
Rockies through Tuesday morning. Lighter snow accumulations are
expected along the Mogollon Rim. Below normal temperatures will
also be common in the Intermountain West and the Southwest with
daytime highs falling as low as 10 to 20 degrees below average.

As the trough slowly progresses eastward, moisture from the
Pacific and from the Gulf of Mexico will combine to produce rain
and thunderstorms beginning Sunday night and continuing into
Monday. Roughly an inch or more of rainfall is forecast for much
of the Tennessee Valley and portions of the Deep South.
Unfortunately, this just the start of a very wet week as the heavy
rain threat is forecast to extend into midweek across the Deep
South and mid-Mississippi Valley with the localized flooding and
severe weather possible mid-week. Additionally, showers will
extend northward into the central Appalachians and the Northeast
late Monday and into Tuesday. Northern New England may see a brief
period of wintry mix Monday afternoon.

While the Southwest and Rockies experience cooler temperatures,
the Nation's Heartland and much of the eastern U.S. will witness
more spring-like temperatures. By Monday, portions of the
Northeast will see high temperatures reach the 60s while some in
the South-Central U.S. see temperatures soar into the 70s. By
Tuesday, mild temperatures will expand up and down the East Coast
with high temperatures forecast to range between 5 to 15 degrees
above normal. Farther west, look for California's temperatures to
also rebound to above normal levels by Tuesday."

An upper-level low is forecast to continue tracking southward
along the California coast and then pivot eastward through
northern Mexico over the beginning of the workweek. A frontal
system will move southward across the Central Great Basin and
Central Rockies into the Southwest, spreading precipitation over
those areas with it. Some snow is expected to continue for higher
elevations, with additional totals reaching over 6 inches in the
Sierra Nevada and the Central Rockies, with lighter totals
elsewhere. Snow and rain showers are possible elsewhere in the
Southwest, with high temperatures there on Monday below normal by
10 to 20 degrees.

Moisture from the Pacific and from the Gulf of Mexico will combine
to produce rain and thunderstorms beginning today and tonight
across the Lower to Middle Mississippi Valley ahead of a cold
front. There is a chance of localized strong thunderstorms and
flooding in these areas. On Monday, rain and thunderstorms should
increase in coverage farther east as the cold front slowly
progresses, with the Tennessee Valley and parts of the Southeast
having the possibility of over an inch of rain. Some lighter rain
should also make its way into the Ohio Valley and the Appalachians
on Monday, with some light wintry weather in the interior
Northeast. As the upper low pivots, it will provide lift for
increasing precipitation in the Southern High Plains Tuesday.
Severe weather is forecast as well, with a Slight Risk of severe
weather delineated in parts of Texas by the Storm Prediction
Center. Rain and thunderstorms remain expected through Thursday in
the southern U.S., so this is just the beginning. Ahead of the
cold front, mild temperatures are forecast from the south-central
U.S. through the Eastern Seaboard, with highs in the 60s extending
as far north as the Mid-Atlantic.

Elsewhere, the Pacific Northwest to Northern Rockies should see
precipitation chances increase through the period as a couple of
upper-level impulses pass through. Higher elevations of the
Cascades and Rockies can expect over a foot of snow through
Tuesday. The north-central tier of the country could see some
light snow by Tuesday with a low pressure system passing through

Valley to the Northeast. Parts of the Tennessee Valley and
southern Appalachians can expect over one inch of rain with lesser
amounts in the eastern Great Lakes and Northeast. Some
precipitation will fall in the form of a wintry mix this afternoon

areas of flash flooding are also possible in the Lower Mississippi
Valley Monday afternoon. By Tuesday, the cold front will slow down
as it approaches the Appalachians and a wave of low pressure will
track northeast along it. This will lead to another round of
showers up and down the East Coast with a chance of a few
thunderstorms in the Southeast. A Slight Risk for flash flooding
has been issued for parts of the Deep South on Tuesday.

Farther west, the headliner of the week will be a highly anomalous
upper trough passing over the Southwest U.S. and northwest Mexico
on Monday. This trough will tap into moisture from both the
subtropical Pacific and Gulf of Mexico, which in turn will force
showers and thunderstorms to flourish over the Southern Plains on
Tuesday and into Tuesday night. Portions of Texas will be at risk
for both severe weather and flash flooding Tuesday evening. Some
locations in west Texas could see rainfall totals over one inch

Severe storms are possible in parts of the Mid-Atlantic and
Southeast ahead of the approaching cold front which is why these

making for a wet Tuesday evening rush hour.

To the south and west, a highly anomalous upper trough is passing
over the Southwest U.S. and northern Mexico this morning. This
trough will tap into moisture from both the subtropical Pacific
and Gulf of Mexico, which in turn will force showers and
thunderstorms to develop over the Southern Plains Tuesday and into
Tuesday night. Slight Risks for both excessive rainfall and severe
weather have been issued for parts of Texas while another Slight
Risk area for excessive rainfall is also positioned over parts of
the central Gulf Coast. Widespread showers and storms will then
track east across the Deep South by Wednesday where the threat for
flash flooding and severe weather will also be present. An

Scattered to widespread showers and thunderstorms can be expected
across the Gulf states and into the Southeast over the next few
days. Convection will develop along and ahead of an advancing cold
front through the Tennessee/Ohio Valleys today and persist across
the Gulf states as the trailing edge stalls to the north of the
Gulf Coast. There will be additional support and forcing for
showers and thunderstorms across the Southern Plains and western
Gulf as a highly anomalous upper trough passes over northern
Mexico toward the Gulf of Mexico. This draped, slow moving front
will continue to provide focus for continuous convective
development. This pattern will be favorable for slow
moving/training thunderstorms that are efficient rain producers.
WPC has identified a large portion of the Gulf states and the
Southeast as having a Slight Risk for excessive rainfall and flash
flooding potential. SPC has Slight Risks for strong to severe
thunderstorms in nearly the same area. Further north, showers will
track through the Northeast making for a wet Tuesday evening rush
hour. The highest rain totals of 2 to 4 inches of rain with
locally higher amounts is expected to occur from southern
Mississippi to southern  South Carolina.

Rain and mountain snow will move into the Pacific Northwest by
this evening with another round coming by midday Thursday-
resulting in locally heavy snow for the highest peaks of the
Cascades and Northern Rockies. The high winds across most of
Montana and the western Dakotas today will begin to taper off
during the overnight hours - there are several counties with High
Wind Warnings and Wind Advisories in effect. Widespread snowmelt
and runoff across North Dakota and northwest Minnesota is causing
flooding of smaller streams and rivers. As ice cover dwindles and
water levels rise, flooding may become more expansive.  A quick
shot of 6 or more inches of snow across the northern Great Lakes

An evolving storm system over Mexico and Texas tapping into both
subtropical Pacific and Gulf of Mexico moisture will generate
areas of showers and thunderstorms from west Texas to the
Southeast. Slight Risks for excessive rainfall and severe weather
continue for portions of central Texas this morning. As
thunderstorms blossom over the Deep South this morning, the
potential for flash flooding and severe storms will also increase
into this afternoon. As a result, both the WPC and SPC have issued
slight risk areas across portions of the Gulf Coast states. The
storm will track east along of a stalled frontal boundary draped
over the Gulf Coast Wednesday night forcing heavy showers and
thunderstorms to move into the Southeast overnight and into
Thursday. In response, Slight Risks for severe weather and
excessive rainfall have been posted for portions of the Carolinas,
Georgia, and northern Florida. By Thursday night, precipitation
associated with this storm will begin to wind down across the
South with only a few thunderstorms passing through southern
Florida by Friday morning. The heaviest rainfall totals from this
system will be found over southern Alabama and Georgia where
rainfall totals of 3 to 5 inches are forecast through Thursday
night.

Meanwhile, an area of low pressure taking shape over the lower
Canadian Prairies will move into the Upper Midwest Wednesday
night. In advance of the storm, snow will fall across the Upper
Midwest and the northern Great Lakes late Wednesday into Thursday.
As an upper level trough associated with this system dives south
and east towards the Northeast on Friday, colder temperatures will
also filter southward behind a passing cold front, leading to a
combination of rain showers along the coast and snow showers in
the central and northern Appalachians. Some accumulating snow in
parts of the interior Northeast is possible Friday evening.

Out west, after a wet and snowy start to the day in the Pacific
Northwest, a brief lull in storm systems will occur the second
half of Wednesday and much of Thursday. A new Pacific storm will
usher in another round of showers and mountain snow late Thursday.
Spotty showers and locally heavy mountain snow, particularly in
the Cascades and Olympic mountains, will continue into Friday."

A surface low and sprawling front near the Gulf Coast will be the
focus for widespread showers and thunderstorms. A nearly
continuous feed of sub-tropical and Gulf moisture over this
frontal boundary will help fuel organized convection from Texas to
the southern Mid-Atlantic and Southeast. The Storm Prediction
Center has Slight Risks for severe weather in effect from east
Texas to the Georgia/South Carolina border. WPC has a Slight Risk
for excessive rainfall for nearly the same area, however there is
a Moderate Risk identified over eastern Mississippi and central
Alabama where 3 to 5 inches of rain will be possible. Rapid
runoff, urban ponding and localized flash floods will be more
prevalent over this region. The risk area shifts to parts of
Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina Thursday into Friday.

A low pressure system dropping south from the Canadian Prairies
today will surge through the Northern and Central Plains while
spreading east through the Upper Mississippi Valley and Great
lakes region Thursday and the Northeast by Friday. A separate cold
front sagging southward into the Northeast will allow snow showers
from eastern New York to northern Maine through early Thursday
morning. Colder air will settle in behind the front as Canadian
High pressure slides in over the central U.S. Rain, snow and a
wintry mix will skirt across the northern-tier states as the
system moves east. Additionally, there will will be coastal rains
for the northern Mid-Atlantic and snow for portions of the Central
and Northern Appalachians.

A system from the North Pacific will move onshore Thursday,
bringing multiple rounds of rain and mountain snows to the Pacific
North; spreading to the Interior by Friday. Snow will be heavy at
times, especially for the highest peaks of the Cascade and Olympic
Ranges. For much of the West and Southwest, mild and dry
conditions expected to continue."

moisture over this frontal boundary will help fuel organized
thunderstorms from the Lower Mississippi Valley to the southern
Mid-Atlantic and Southeast. The Storm Prediction Center has Slight
Risks for severe weather in effect over southern Georgia,
southeast Alabama, and northern Florida. WPC maintains a Moderate
Risk over far eastern Mississippi and central Alabama through
early morning where 1 to 3 inches of rain is possible. Rapid
runoff, urban ponding and localized flash floods will be more
prevalent over this region. The Slight Risk area shifts to parts
of Georgia, South Carolina and southern North Carolina Thursday
into Night with another 1 to 2 inches of rain expected. By Friday,
a drier and cooler stretch of weather will settle in across the
south and persist into the upcoming weekend.

A low pressure system will track into the Upper Mississippi Valley
and Great lakes regions today and the Northeast on Friday. On the
northern and western flanks of this storm system, a cold front
will push southward leading to an injection of colder air along
and east of the Mississippi River by the start of the weekend.
This will lead to wintry weather, most notably across the Upper
Peninsula of Michigan where precipitation enhancement from Lake
Superior will aid snow accumulations of 6 to 12 inches of snow.
The best chances for snow in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic will
be in the Appalachians with light accumulations possible.
Additionally, there will will be coastal rains for the northern
Mid-Atlantic while some snow may mix in with the rain in portions
of southern New England.

In the West, a system from the northeast Pacific will move onshore
Thursday, bringing multiple rounds of rain and mountain snows to
the Pacific Northwest spreading into the interior Northwest by
Friday. Snow will be heavy at times, especially for the highest

air-mass and lead to snow in the Rockies and Central High Plains.
While exact accumulations are still subject to change, there is a
good chance for greater than 6 inches of snow in portions of the
Colorado Rockies, northern New Mexico, and west-central Nebraska.
Meanwhile, in the Northwest and Northern Rockies a cold dome of
Canadian High Pressure will spill frigid temperatures into these

12 inches of snow are possible between Friday and into Saturday
night.

To the east, a stalled frontal boundary draped over the
mid-Mississippi Valley and the Tennessee Valley will aid in the
development of scattered showers and thunderstorms across these
regions this evening. As a surface low pressure tracks east from
the Central Plains on Thursday, additional showers and
thunderstorms will develop along a warm front that will extend
from the mid-Mississippi Valley into the Ohio and Tennessee
Valleys. Some thunderstorms will produce heavy rainfall rates and
the potential exists for localized flash flooding. A Marginal Risk
for excessive rainfall has been issued for portions of these
regions on Thursday while a Slight Risk for severe weather extends
from northeast Texas and the mid-Mississippi Valley to the Ohio

U.S. on Friday, it will stall over Texas and lift north as a warm
front later that evening. This will lead to another round of
showers and thunderstorms in the Southern Plains Friday evening
where rain may fall heavily at times.

Elsewhere, portions of northern New England may pick up several
inches of snow ahead of a storm system tracking into southeastern
Canada by Friday morning. Some lake effect snow showers are also
possible Friday morning over the northern Great Lakes but
accumulations will be light on average. The Nation's Heartland can
expect a mild Thursday with temperature anomalies ranging between
15 to 20 degrees above normal. It will then be the East Coast's
turn for spring-like temperatures come Friday. Both the Nation's
Heartland and the Northeast will cool down this weekend in wake of

...Flash flooding potential continues today for the Southwest,
while rain and strong thunderstorms spread into the Southern
Plains...

...Heavy snow across the Northern High Plains, Central Plains, and
higher elevations of the West...

A low pressure system is expected to slowly move across the Four
Corners region eastward into the Southern Plains for the end of
the week ahead of an upper-level trough, spreading precipitation
to those areas. Heavy rain could continue during the day today for
the Southwest before winding down tonight, and Flash Flood Watches
remain in effect there. Rain and thunderstorms should spread into
the Southern Plains today as well, and there is a Slight Risk of
severe weather in effect for parts of southeastern New Mexico and
western Texas, along with the potential for a couple of inches of
rain in Oklahoma. Farther east, a slowly moving front across the
Lower Mississippi Valley and Southeast will lead to rain for those
areas and into the Tennessee and Lower Ohio Valleys. Currently,
over an inch of rain is forecast for portions of Tennessee and
Kentucky on Saturday, which could cause isolated flooding.

As a strong high pressure system presses southward through western
Canada, snow is expected to spread ahead of it into the Northern
High Plains. Upper-level energy and the aforementioned low
pressure system should also lead to snow developing in the Central
Rockies and into the Central Plains. Persistent snowfall across
the Northern Great Basin, Northern Rockies, and Northern High
Plains through Sunday morning should create snowfall totals of a
foot to 18 inches in those areas. Snow in the Central Plains looks
to begin Friday evening and wind down on Saturday, and snowfall
amounts of over 6 inches are forecast there. An upper-level low is
forecast to spin offshore in the Eastern Pacific Saturday into
Sunday, leading to multiple rounds of precipitation for the
Pacific Northwest into the Intermountain West and California.
Heavy snow is possible for the Cascades and Sierra Nevada.

Elsewhere, a frontal system is expected to pass through the
Mid-Atlantic and Northeast today, leading to rain in the bulk of
those areas but snow in far northern New England. Over 6 inches of
snow is possible in far northern Maine, along with light freezing
rain in northern Vermont and New Hampshire and western Maine.

The cold high pressure system will bring much below normal
temperatures to the Northwest through the end of the week. Below
average temperatures (10 to 25 degrees below normal for highs) are
also forecast for the Central High Plains today, spreading into
the Middle Mississippi Valley toward the Ohio Valley Saturday.
Meanwhile, south of the front, the Gulf Coast states will be
warmer than normal. The Eastern Seaboard can expect warm weather
today, with highs in the 70s for the Mid-Atlantic and in the 60s
for southern New England, but should cool to near normal Saturday
after the cold front passes."

...Severe Weather in the High Southern Plains this evening,
showers and thunderstorms to make for a wet weekend in the
Mid-South Saturday and the Gulf Coast on Sunday...

...Heavy snow across the Northern High Plains, Central Plains, and
higher elevations of the West...

...Cooler temperatures to engulf the Midwest and Northeast this
weekend, frigid temperatures in the Northern Plains and Rockies,
warmer temperatures along the Gulf Coast...

A low pressure system in the Southwest will emerge into the
Southern Plains this evening causing additional scattered showers
and thunderstorms to develop over the South-Central United States.
Some thunderstorms could be severe, which is why Slight and
Enhanced Risks for severe thunderstorms have been posted in west
Texas and eastern New Mexico this evening. There is also a
Marginal Risk for excessive rainfall over the Red River Valley
where 1 to 2 inches of rainfall is expected. The rain and
thunderstorm threat moves east tonight and into Saturday across
the Mid-South where a broad Marginal Risk area for excessive
rainfall is in place from eastern Oklahoma to the Smokey
Mountains. By Sunday, the intensity of showers and thunderstorms
will wain as a frontal boundary sets up shop over the Deep South.
Still, spotty showers and thunderstorms will make for a wet day in
portions of the Southern Plains and Southeast.

Meanwhile, our neighbors in the Central Rockies, Central Plains,
and Northwest will experience heavy snowfall this weekend.
Portions of the Colorado Rockies, the San Juan Mountains, and the
Wasatch will receive 6 to 12 inches of snow with locally higher
amounts possible. On the northern flank of the storm system
tracking through the Southern U.S., a swath of heavy snow will
develop across the High Plains of northwest Kansas, western
Nebraska, and extending as far north as the Black Hills of South
Dakota. On average, parts of northwest Kansas and western Nebraska
will pick up 3 to 6"" of with the Black Hills picking up as much as
a foot. Snow will taper off in these regions by Saturday, but snow
will be an ongoing occurrence in northern and western Montana
throughout the weekend. Significant snowfall accumulations over a
foot are expected there with 1 to 2 feet of snow forecast. Further
west the Cascades, the Shasta of Northern California, and the
Sierra Nevada can expect 1 to 2 feet of snow through the weekend
with snow continuing over the Sierra Nevada into Monday.

Temperature wise, after a spring-like and breezy Friday in the
Northeast and Mid-Atlantic this afternoon a passing cold front
will usher in cooler temperatures for the weekend. Below normal
daily max temperatures on the order of 5 to 15 degrees below
normal will be common this weekend in California, the Midwest, the
Mid-Atlantic, and the Northeast. The coldest temperatures versus
normal this weekend will be found in Montana where daily low
temperatures will be sub-zero for some each day. Even the Pacific
Northwest can expect subfreezing temperatures. On the flip side,
the Gulf Coast will bask in above normal temperatures with high
temperatures approaching 80 degrees."

...Wet weekend in store for the Southern Plains to Ohio Valley...

...Multiple feet of snow forecast for the Sierra Nevada as the
Northwest also receives heavy snow...

...Frigid temperatures from the Northern Great Basin to Northern
High Plains...

A frontal boundary is expected to meander across the Southern
Plains, Lower Mississippi Valley, and Southeast over the weekend.
Moisture inflow into the vicinity of this front will create rain
chances along and north of it. 1 to 2 inches of rain could occur
in portions of the Mississippi Valley to the Ohio and Tennessee
Valleys through Saturday night, and localized flooding is
possible. Along the north side of the precipitation, mix or snow
is expected for parts of the Middle Mississippi Valley into the
Ohio Valley and Central Appalachians, with a couple of inches of
snow forecast. Then on Sunday, rain and thunderstorms will refocus
farther west across the Southern Plains, with a few strong storms
and locally heavy rain possible. Scattered showers are expected
farther east in the Southeast as well.

An upper-level low is forecast to drift southward across the
eastern Pacific very slowly through the weekend, with stalled
frontal systems at the surface. These features will lead to
persistent precipitation in parts of the West. Rain is expected to
spread along the California coast, with snow or mixed
precipitation in the Pacific Northwest and Intermountain West.
Higher elevations could see heavy snow, especially the Sierra
Nevada--where snow over the next two days alone will be measured
in multiple feet. Elsewhere across the Shastas, Sawtooth
Mountains, and Wind River Mountains and Tetons should also receive
heavy snow in higher elevations. Persistent snow in parts of
Montana through Sunday morning could create additional snow totals
over 6 inches there. Later Sunday, light snows are forecast to
move east from Montana into the north-central tier.

The frontal boundaries should divide colder than average
temperatures to the north (from the Central Plains to Middle
Mississippi Valley and Ohio Valley) from warmer than average
temperatures to the south (along the Gulf Coast states).
Meanwhile, the largest temperature anomalies are forecast for the
Northern Great Basin to Northern Rockies and Northern High Plains.
Parts of Montana in particular could see high temperatures 40
degrees below normal on Saturday."

A frontal boundary stretching from the Southern Plains to the
Southeast will continue to stick around tonight and into Sunday.
As a moist southwest flow intersects the front, areas of showers
will form and lead to wet conditions over the Ohio Valley and
Mid-South. Thunderstorms may also form from west Texas to the
Tennessee Valley. There will be some light wintry precipitation
with an inch or two of snow on average possible in the central
Appalachians this evening. Showers will also track across the
Mid-Atlantic tonight and early Sunday morning with drier
conditions anticipated the second half of the day. The frontal
boundary will push south Sunday and Monday making the Gulf Coast
and Southern Plains the most favored areas to witness showers and
thunderstorms some of which could be heavy. Some very localized
flooding is possible in portions of Oklahoma on Monday.

An upper-level low is forecast to drift southward very slowly
along the West Coast Sunday and into the first half of next week,
with stalled frontal systems at the surface across the northern
Great Basin and northern Rockies. These features will lead to
persistent precipitation in parts of the West. Periods of rain
will be common along the California coast with snow or mixed
precipitation in the Pacific Northwest. Rainfall amounts of 1 to 2
inches are forecast in the higher elevations of Southern
California and northern suburbs of Los Angeles, which combined
with recent heavy rainfall could lead to localized flash flooding
on Monday. This has resulted in the issuance of a Marginal Risk
for excessive rainfall in portions of Southern California on
Monday. Higher elevations of California will see heavy snow,
especially the Sierra Nevada where snow over the next two days
alone will be measured in multiple feet. Elsewhere across the
Intermountain West should also receive heavy snow in the higher
elevations. Prolonged periods of snow in the Sawtooth, Tetons, and
Wind River mountains through Sunday morning could create
additional snow totals over 6 inches there. Later Sunday, light
snows are forecast to move east from Montana into the
north-central tier before tapering off on Monday thanks to high
pressure building in across the region.

North of the stalled frontal boundary in the Deep South will
feature seasonally cooler temperatures on average both Sunday and
Monday in the Central Plains, Mid and Upper Mississippi Valley,
and extending into the Ohio Valley and Northeast. Parts of Montana
will remains stuck in a cold temperature regime through Monday
with daily temperature anomalies as cold as 30 degrees below
normal. In contrast, the Gulf Coast will bask in above normal
temperatures where daytime highs Sunday and Monday for some
locations will hit 80 degrees. In fact, some parts of the Florida
Panhandle will even make a run at 90 degrees on Sunday. Much of
the Four Corners region and the central High Plains will
experience warm temperature anomalies ranging between 10 to 15
degrees above normal on average through the first half of the week."

An upper-level low is forecast to slowly drift southward along the
West Coast for the beginning of the week, pushing a slow-moving
cold front ahead of it through California as a stalled frontal
system remains across the Intermountain West. These features are
expected to lead to persistent precipitation for the Great Basin
into California. Heavy snow will occur in higher elevations of the
Sierra Nevada, measured in multiple feet. In lower elevations of
coastal California, rain chances should begin to increase
especially on Monday. Rainfall amounts could be over 2 inches,
which may cause flooding and flash flooding in some locations.
Urban areas and burn scars could particularly have these problems.

A frontal boundary is forecast to meander across the Southern
Plains through the Lower Mississippi Valley and Southeast over the
next couple of days. Moisture inflow into the the vicinity of the
front will lead to scattered showers and thunderstorms across
those regions and northward. Rainfall amounts could reach over an
inch across portions of Texas, eastern Oklahoma, and Arkansas
through Monday night, so there is some potential for flash
flooding there. The Big Bend area of Texas can expect the
possibility of severe thunderstorms Sunday. Lighter rain is
possible for the Tennessee Valley, Lower Ohio Valley, and the
Southeast today into Monday.

Farther north, snow is expected to spread eastward from Montana
this morning into the north-central tier of the country today,
with 2 to 4 inches of snow possible in parts of North Dakota and
Minnesota. Mixed precipitation or snow could reach the Northeast
Monday night ahead of another frontal system.

The Northern High Plains will remain below normal temperature-wise
the next couple of days, though not quite as frigid as recently.
The West Coast should also have high temperatures 10 to 20 degrees
below average with the influence from the upper low. Today, the
Central/Southern Plains will be cooler than normal, but should

...Severe weather and flash flooding forecast for the Southern
Plains through Wednesday...

An anomalously strong upper-level low is forecast to sit over
California through midweek, while upper-level energy moves
eastward over the Four Corners by Wednesday night. This will cause
precipitation over the Intermountain West over the next couple of
days. Higher elevations of northern California and northwestern
Nevada could see an additional foot of snow through tonight. Snow
levels should lower across the Southwest after cold frontal
passages, bringing snow to the Mogollon Rim as well as to the
Wasatch and Central Rockies through Wednesday night. Light to
moderate snow (totals under 6 inches for the most part) is
expected for the north-central U.S. tonight into Wednesday, with
some snow spreading into parts of the Northeast Wednesday night.
This is before the potential for a swath of heavier snow for
portions of the Northern/Central Plains on Thursday.

Ahead of the upper-level energy, moisture is expected to flow in
from the Gulf of Mexico and interact with a front that is forecast
to meander across the Southern Plains to Southeast again today and
finally lift northward Wednesday. Scattered showers and
thunderstorms are possible all around these areas, but the area
with the greatest threats from the storms will be the Southern
Plains. Slight to Enhanced Risks of severe thunderstorms are in
place along with Slight Risks for excessive rainfall/flash
flooding for much of the Southern Plains today and Wednesday. By
Wednesday, rainfall amounts over an inch in the Ohio Valley could
lead to flash flooding as well.

Additionally, the upper low will help cause temperatures that are
below normal by 10 to 20 degrees across California into the
Central Great Basin and Southwest. Meanwhile, the Gulf Coast
states can expect above normal temperatures south of the warm
front. The Central Plains should see a large temperature swing
over the next couple of days, with highs today in the 40s and 50s
but exceeding 70 degrees tomorrow. Warmth on Wednesday will spread
into the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys as well."

...Snow spreads from the Intermountain West across the
north-central U.S. over the next couple of days...

...Severe weather and flash flooding forecast for the Southern
Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley through Wednesday...

...Colder western regions, May-like temperatures arrive in eastern
regions late week...

An anomalously strong upper-level low is forecast to sit over
California through midweek, while upper-level disturbances moves
eastward over the Four Corners late Wednesday. This will generate
precipitation across the Intermountain West over the next couple
of days. Higher elevations of northern California and northwestern
Nevada could see an additional foot of snow through tonight. Look
for snow levels to drop across the Southwest in wake of a passing
cold front, bringing snow to the Mogollon Rim as well as to the
Wasatch and Central Rockies through Wednesday night. Snow totals
across these areas will average 6 to 12 inches with the highest
totals approaching 2 feet in the highest elevations. By Thursday,
periods of snow will overspread the central High Plains where
disruptive snowfall accumulations of 4 to 6 inches are possible.
Blizzard Warnings have been issued for western Nebraska and
southeastern Wyoming on Thursday because of a developing low
pressure system to the south and strong Canadian high pressure to
the north generating strong northeasterly winds. This should lead
to drifting snow and whiteout conditions in these areas .

Ahead of the upper-level disturbance, Gulf of Mexico moisture is
expected interact with a warm front that is forecast to gradually
lift northward across the Southern Plains and into the Mid-South
on Wednesday. Scattered showers and thunderstorms are possible all
around these areas, but the area with the greatest threats from
the storms today and Wednesday will be the Southern Plains. Slight
to Enhanced Risks of severe thunderstorms are in place along with
Slight Risks for excessive rainfall/flash flooding for much of the
Southern Plains today and Wednesday. By Wednesday, rainfall
amounts over an inch in the Ohio Valley could lead to flash
flooding as well. Due to the slow progression of the longwave
upper-level trough over the West Coast, expect the Lower and
Middle Mississippi Valleys to become most at risk for severe
storms and heavy rain on Thursday.

Temperature wise, the upper low will help force temperatures to
fall 10 to 20 degrees below normal across California into the
Central Great Basin and Southwest. By Thursday, a cold front will
usher in much colder temperatures to the High Plains. While the
West trends colder, eastern and southern regions will bask in
May-like temperatures the second half of the week. The Gulf Coast
states will remain quite warm through the week but look for the
Southern Plains to trend colder by Friday. Abnormally warm
temperatures will arrive in the Midwest and the Mid-South tomorrow
then reach the East Coast by Thursday. By Friday, some portions of
the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic will have a chance to hit 80
degrees for the first time this year."

...Much below average temperatures in the West and much above
average temperatures in the East...

An anomalously strong upper-level low is forecast to sit over
California through midweek, while upper-level disturbances moves
eastward over the Four Corners into the Plains by Thursday. This
will generate precipitation across the Intermountain West through
Thursday, and with snow levels dropping, snow totals of generally
6 to 12 inches are forecast across the Mogollon Rim, Wasatch, and
Central Rockies, with locally higher amounts in the highest
elevations. Snow is expected to spread into the Central Plains by
Thursday, with a swath of 4 to 6 inches of snow. Blizzard Warnings
have been issued for western Nebraska and southeastern Wyoming on
Thursday because of a developing low pressure system to the south
and strong Canadian high pressure to the north generating strong
northeasterly winds. This should lead to drifting snow and
whiteout conditions in these areas. Light snow is forecast for the
Northern Plains and Upper Midwest as well.

Farther east, rain and thunderstorms are expected as a warm front
lifts north through the Plains, Mississippi Valley, and Ohio
Valley today. There is an Enhanced Risk of severe thunderstorms in
place as well as a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall/flash
flooding for the Southern Plains today, where the best combination
of moisture, lift, and instability will be. Then on Thursday into
Friday, a cold front pushes eastward across the Central U.S., and
rain and thunderstorms should focus ahead of it. Thus the severe
weather and flash flooding threats will shift eastward into the
Mississippi Valley and Ohio Valley. 

Temperatures are expected to be colder than average over
California and the Southwest due to the upper-level low, while the
Northern Plains will see high temperatures below normal by more
than 20 degrees on Thursday as a cold high pressure system builds
in. Meanwhile, temperatures in the eastern U.S. are forecast to be
more like May temperatures. Today high temperatures should reach
into the 70s as far north as the Central Plains and Tennessee
Valley, spreading into the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic on
Thursday."

The weather pattern will be a busy one across the Lower 48 over
the next few days thanks to a slow moving upper level trough and a
series of disturbances ejecting into the Nation's Heartland.
Leading off with the wintry impacts, precipitation will breakout
across the Four Corners region tonight and into Thursday. Snow
levels will drop across the region today and into tomorrow with 6
to 12 inches forecast across the Mogollon Rim, Wasatch, and
Central Rockies. Locally higher amounts are anticipated in the
highest elevations. Snow should spread into the Central Plains by
Thursday, with a swath of 4 to 6 inches of snow. Blizzard Warnings
remain in place across western Nebraska and southeastern Wyoming
on Thursday due to a developing low pressure system to the south
and strong Canadian high pressure to the north generating strong
northeasterly winds. This should lead to drifting snow and
whiteout conditions in these areas. Periods of snow is forecast
for the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest as well on Thursday with
some accumulations possible.

Farther east, rain and thunderstorms are expected as a warm front
lifts north through the Plains, Mississippi Valley, and Ohio
Valley this evening. There is an Enhanced Risk of severe
thunderstorms in place as well as a Slight Risk of excessive
rainfall/flash flooding for the Southern Plains this afternoon and
evening. By Thursday, a surging cold front pushes eastward across
the Central U.S. as the aforementioned warm front continues to
drift north. The result is an even larger area of showers and
thunderstorms with severe weather and flash flooding threats will
shift eastward into the Mississippi and Ohio Valleys. The cold
front will continue to advance east on Friday forcing more showers
and thunderstorms to develop in the Northeast where a few
thunderstorms could be severe and produce heavy downpours.

The Nation's Heartland will endure a whiplash of temperature
regimes over the next 48 hours as the Midwest and Ohio Valleys
initially bask in much above normal temperatures this afternoon
and through Thursday. High temperatures from the Central Plains to
the Mid-Atlantic coast on Thursday will soar into the 70s while
morning lows approach record warm levels in parts of the Southern
Plains and Southeast. Once the cold front passes through the
Mississippi Valley Thursday night, an injection of cold Canadian
air will cause temperatures to plummet to well below normal
levels. Daytime highs Friday in the Midwest could be over 30
degrees colder than Thursday's observed high temperatures.
Meanwhile, the East Coast will continue to warm up ahead of the
cold front on Friday with high temperatures in the mid-upper 70s
in the Mid-Atlantic. The East Coast's turn for colder temperatures
arrives Friday night as the cold front passes through, leading to
a much cooler temperature regime over the weekend."

...Heavy rain and severe thunderstorms expected in the central and
eastern U.S. ahead of a cold front...

...Much below average temperatures in the West and much above

A developing low pressure system in the Central High Plains will
create busy weather today across much of the U.S. North of the
low, snow is forecast to continue across the Central Rockies,
where an additional foot or more of snow is possible in higher
elevations. A swath of lighter snow should spread into the
Central/Northern Plains, along with some light freezing rain. High
winds due to a tight pressure gradient between the low and a
surface high to the north could create blizzard conditions for
southeastern Wyoming, northeastern Colorado, and western Nebraska.

Meanwhile, rain and thunderstorms are expected east of the cold
front associated with the low and in the vicinity of its warm
front. Today, these thunderstorms will be most widespread in the
Mississippi Valley into the Ohio Valley. A couple of Enhanced
Risks for severe thunderstorms are in place today from the Storm
Prediction Center in those regions, along with a Slight Risk of
excessive rainfall/flash flooding. On Friday, the cold front
should press east and south, moving showers and thunderstorms into
the East. A few strong storms can be expected in parts of the Ohio
Valley to Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. Higher rainfall totals will
be located from the Lower Mississippi Valley into the Tennessee
Valley, so localized flash flooding is possible there Friday.

The aforementioned cold front will get reinforced by another cold
front today, creating quite the temperature divide between cold to
the west and warm to the east. Today, highs 10 to 20 degrees below
average are forecast for the Northern High Plains with an
encroaching Canadian cold high pressure system, as well as
California to the Southwest. East of there, warmth will be
widespread, with temperatures 10 to 25 degrees above normal
forecast for the Mississippi Valley to much of the Eastern
Seaboard. Widespread record temperatures, particularly record high
minimum temperatures, are expected over the next couple of days in
the central and eastern U.S. On Friday, the cold front sweeping
across the Plains should cool temperatures considerably--from
highs in the 70s and 80s today to highs in the 40s and 50s in
Kansas and the Southern Plains, for example."

A low pressure system, which is emerging from the Rockies, will
produce heavy snowfall for the Central Rockies tonight. A blizzard
warning is in effect for parts of northeastern Colorado,
southeastern Wyoming, southwestern Nebraska and northwestern
Kansas. Snow will spread across the Central Plains and into the
Upper Midwest on Friday as the system moves swiftly off into
Ontario. Snowfall amounts are likely to be between 6-12 inches for
the mountains of Utah and Colorado while lake effect may produce
similar amounts over the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. A strong
area of high pressure will build in over the Central U.S. behind
the fast moving system on Friday.

A slow moving cold front on the southern end of the low pressure
system will produce heavy rain and severe thunderstorms for parts
of the Middle Mississippi/Ohio Valleys tonight, then eastern Texas
and the Lower Mississippi Valley tomorrow. As a result, SPC issued
a Slight Risk of Severe Thunderstorms over the Mississippi Valley
with embedded areas of Enhanced Risk over the Upper Mississippi
Valley and another area over the Middle Mississippi/Ohio Valleys.
Up to an inch of rain is expected for the Middle Mississippi/Ohio
Valleys this evening while up to 3 inches are possible from
eastern Texas into the Lower Mississippi Valley through Sunday. A
Slight Risk of Excessive Rainfall is in effect for those areas as
a result.

Record high temperatures are possible across the Mid-Atlantic and
Florida on Friday ahead of the low pressure system. Temperatures
will be up to 25 degrees above average across the entire eastern
U.S. tomorrow while the inverse will be true for the
Northern/Central Plains as a powerful area of high pressure
filters cold air into the Central U.S.. Temperatures will be 15-20

The first full day of Spring will offer both wintry and very warm
weather conditions along either side of a strong front pressing
southeastward across the Ohio Valley, Mid to Lower Mississippi
Valley and into portions of the Northeast.  A heavy snow threat
will be shifting northeastward Friday into portions of the Upper
Great Lakes as the storm that brought Blizzard conditions to
portions of the Central Rockies and Central Plains reorganizes
early Friday across the Great Lakes into southeast Canada.  This
system is fast moving which should keep any heavy snow threat
short lived across the Upper Great Lakes Friday.

The strong front pushing southeastward Friday across the Ohio
Valley, Lower Mississippi Valley into portions of the northeast
will be the dividing line between potentially record high
temperatures from the Nations Capital southward into Florida and
much below average temperatures across the mid section of the
nation.  High temperatures Friday will be 10 to 20 degrees above
average from the Mississippi River to the east coast and 10 to 20
degrees below average through all of the Plains.  This cold air
will be pressing eastward by the beginning of the weekend,
bringing much cooler temperatures Saturday from New England into
the Mid-Atlantic.

The strong frontal boundary will also be the focus for potentially
heavy rains and flash flooding from east Texas into the Lower
Mississippi Valley on Friday.  The combination of much above
average moisture levels along this front and strong upper level
forcing will support the heavy rain potential across these areas."

system. At the same time, another low pressure system will descend
over the Pacific Northwest from the Canadian Meritime. Snow totals
between 4-8 inches are expected across the Cascades and Olympics
with locally higher amounts possible at the highest peaks.

Meanwhile to the east, an area of low pressure will develop along
the lee side of the Rockies Sunday morning and begin moving
eastward. This system will produce 1-2 inches of rain for a swath
of real estate extending from the Southern Plains into the
Mid-Atlantic through Monday. Snow will fall on the north side of
the low from northern Pennsylvania through southern New England.
There's a high probability of heavy snow impacting the Catskills
and southern Adirondacks on Monday with accumulations likely to be
between 3-6 inches.

An upper-level ridge will build in behind the eastern U.S. system
which will lead to high temperatures dropping 15-20 degrees below
average for much of the Mississippi Valley on Sunday. Surface high
pressure will extend back across the Northeast while the area of

Starting in Southern California, a wave of low pressure will
approach from the west causing showers and thunderstorms to move
ashore this evening. Rainfall rates could approach one inch per
hour around the Los Angeles metro area. As a result, a Slight Risk
for excessive rainfall is in place for the city and neighboring
suburbs. The threat for flash flooding extends as far north as the
southern suburbs of the Bay Area. Further inland, snow is likely
to fall in the southern Sierra Nevada with over 8 inches possible
in the highest elevations. As this storm system moves est on
Monday, an upper level trough will enter the fray over the Pacific
Northwest leading to coastal/valley rain and mountain snow through
mid-week. The higher elevations of the Cascades and Sierra Nevada
may be measuring snowfall by the foot into the middle of the week.

Switching coast lines, showers and thunderstorms tracking through
the Ohio Valley this afternoon will head for the eastern Great
Lakes and northern Mid-Atlantic tonight while an area of low
pressure strengthens near the North Carolina Outer Banks Monday
morning. As the storm intensifies off the DelMarVa coast Monday
afternoon, periods of rain will develop along and east of I-95.
Rain will fall heavily at times from New Jersey to southern New
England where rainfall amounts in excess of 2 inches are possible.
Farther north, cold air remains entrenched in the northern
Appalachians causing precipitation to fall as snow. The Poconos,
Catskills, Adirondacks, Berkshires, Green and White mountains will
all have the potential to receive over 8 inches of snow resulting
in various winter related watches and warnings/advisories being
issued through Tuesday morning. The storm will be fast moving and
drier conditions will return across the Northeast some time

active spring time precipitation pattern. The lead storm is
strengthening off the Mid-Atlantic coast this afternoon and will
be positioned near the southern New England coast Monday night

Mid-Atlantic into New England. Farther north, heavy snow will take
shape in the higher elevations of the Catskills, Adirondacks,
Berkshires, Green and White Mountains this evening. Look for drier
conditions to return on Tuesday as high pressure makes a brief
stop over the Northeast before another round of precipitation
arrive Tuesday night and into Wednesday.

Behind this lead storm, another storm system is going to track
across the Southwest this afternoon and into the Central to
Southern Plains overnight. Modest precipitation amounts are
expected with this storm system in the Southwest, Great Basin and
Central Rockies. As this system emerges into the Plains late
Monday into early Tuesday, precipitation coverage and intensities
are forecast to increase as it taps into Gulf of Mexico moisture. 
Moderate to heavy rains expected to spread from portions of the
Central Plains into the Mid Mississippi Valley, Ohio Valley,
Tennessee Valley, and Appalachians Tuesday into Tuesday night.
Thunderstorms with this system may produce severe weather from
portions of the Central to Southern Plains, eastward into the
Lower to Mid Mississippi Valley and Tennessee Valley. Localized
areas of flash flooding are also possible in these areas as well.
Periods of rain will then push into the Mid-Atlantic Tuesday night
and into Wednesday as the storm tracks off the DelMarVa coast
Wednesday afternoon. Some snow is possible in the higher
elevations of the interior Northeast on Wednesday as well.

A strong cold front will drop southeastward from the Pacific
Northwest this afternoon across the Northern Rockies, Great Basin
and as far south as southern California by early Wednesday.  This
front will cause temperatures to drop below normal through
mid-week from the West Coast to the Central Rockies. Most of the
West over the next few days can anticipate showery conditions in
the lower elevations and snow at higher elevations. Meanwhile,
temperatures across the South will look more like May with
temperatures in the 70s and 80s. In fact, some locations in West
and South Texas may soar as high as 90 degrees Wednesday afternoon."

across much of the West, while above average temperatures stretch
across the South and the Plains...

...Accumulating snows possible Wednesday into early Thursday

into the Upper Great Lakes...

Precipitation is expected to continue to expand in coverage and
intensity Tuesday as a quick moving area of low pressure moves
from the Southern Plains, across the Lower Mississippi Valley and
into the Tennessee Valley.  This area of low pressure will have
above average levels of moisture associated with it resulting in a
large stripe of heavy rains stretching from the Lower Mississippi
Valley, across the Tennessee Valley, Southern Appalachians and
Southern Mid-Atlantic.  The greatest risk of flash flooding with
this storm will be across portions of the Upper Tennessee Valley
into the Southern Appalachians where soils are saturated from
heavy rains over the past few weeks.  In addition to the flash
flood threat with this storm, severe thunderstorms are also
possible across western to central Tennessee, far eastern
Arkansas, northern Mississippi, northern Alabama and northwest
Georgia Tuesday into Tuesday night.   By Wednesday, this storm
will bring rains across the Mid-Atlantic into southern New
England.  At the moment, there is no threat of flash flooding or
severe weather across these areas.

An amplifying upper level trof will be pushing slowly
southeastward across much of the west from the west coast into the
Great Basin and Northern Rockies over the next 2 days  This system
will support a showery pattern across these regions with low
elevation rains and higher elevation snows.  Precipitation totals
are expected to be only on the light to moderate side across much
of the west.  With this showery pattern, temperatures are expected
to remain well below average into the middle part of this week
along the west coast, into the Great Basin and Northern Rockies. 
In contrast to this, above average temperatures will stretch
through the Plains and South on Tuesday, expanding eastward into
much of the Mississippi Valley, Ohio Valley and Southern
Mid-Atlantic on Wednesday.  Wednesday will bring much cooler
temperatures to the Northern Plains as a strong cold front presses
southeastward across this region.   An area of low pressure moving
northeastward along this front will support accumulating snow
potential Wednesday into early Thursday from the Northern Plains,
across the Upper Mississippi Valley and into the Upper Great Lakes."

and the Upper Great Lakes...

Hazardous weather will drive an active evening and overnight
period across portions of the Tennessee Valley and the Southern
Appalachians as a wave of low pressure advances quickly off to the
east along a front draped from the Tennessee Valley into the
interior of the Southeast. Numerous showers and thunderstorms are
expected across this region with an emphasis on the Mid-South
where severe weather is likely to develop this evening, including
a threat of large hail, damaging winds and tornadoes. Heavy
rainfall associated with this will also raise the concern for
flash flooding, and especially considering the wet antecedent soil
conditions across the Mid-South. In fact, the Storm Prediction
Center has highlighted an Enhanced Risk of severe weather, and the
Weather Prediction Center has highlighted a Moderate Risk of
excessive rainfall going into the overnight hours for this region.

Later tonight, some of the threat of severe weather and flash
flooding will cross the Southern Appalachians, but the weather
will be improving across the Tennessee Valley and Southeast by
early Wednesday as the aforementioned wave of low pressure reaches
the Mid-Atlantic coast. Rain will shift farther north into areas
of the Mid-Atlantic and southern New England on Wednesday, but
conditions here should begin to improve later in the day as the
low center then begins to move out to sea. Most of the eastern
U.S. should then see dry and tranquil weather on Thursday as high
pressure noses down over the region.

Meanwhile, a strengthening upper-level trof of low pressure will
be pushing slowly southeastward across much of the West, including
the Great Basin and Northern Rockies over the next couple of days.
This will drive an unsettled pattern throughout the Intermountain
West with numerous showers that will drive low elevation rains and
accumulating snowfall for the higher terrain. In fact, an
additional 1 to 2 feet of snowfall is expected locally with an
emphasis on the Sierra-Nevada, and the Wasatch. With this showery
pattern, temperatures are expected to remain well below average
across most of the West, and especially the Southwest through the
remainder of the week. In contrast to this, above average
temperatures will stretch through the Southern Plains and Lower
Mississippi Valley on Wednesday and spread east to encompass much
of the Ohio Valley, Mid-Atlantic and the remainder of the South by
the end of the week.

Elsewhere, Wednesday will bring much cooler temperatures to the
Northern Plains as a strong cold front presses southeastward
across this region. An area of low pressure moving northeastward
along this front will support some accumulating snow potential
Wednesday into early Thursday from the Northern Plains, across the
Upper Mississippi Valley and into the Upper Great Lakes. The
expectation is that these amounts will be generally light with a
few inches possible."

On the opposite end of the weather spectrum, a strong cold front
will be bringing colder temperatures Wednesday from the Northern
Plains into the Upper Great Lakes.  An area of low pressure moving
along this frontal boundary will enhance precipitation to its
north with accumulating snows possible from portions of the
Northern Plains into the Upper Great Lakes.  Heaviest totals
expected from northern Wisconsin into the U.P. of Michigan where
2-4"" amounts are possible.

The unsettled weather pattern that has been affecting large
portions of the western U.S. with showery conditions and below
average temperatures will continue through Wednesday and Thursday.
 The strong mid to upper level trof responsible for this recent
pattern will be pushing southeastward from along the west coast
Wednesday morning, into the Great Basin on Thursday and into the

precipitation totals expected across these areas with locally
heavy snows through the Cascades, Sierra, Northern Rockies into
the Wasatch.  Additional showers and higher elevation snows
expected to move back into the Pacific Northwest late Thursday
into early Friday associated with an area of disturbed weather
moving southeast toward the Pacific Northwest coast.

A deep upper-level trough advancing slowly through the Western
U.S. will keep conditions unsettled across portions of the Great
Basin through Friday and the Rockies going through Saturday.
Numerous showers with low elevation rains and higher elevation
snows are expected, and especially over the central Rockies by
Saturday where heavy accumulating snowfall is expected. This will
be facilitated by a deepening area of low pressure over the
central High Plains which will transport plenty of moisture
westward back into Colorado high country and adjacent areas of
southeast Wyoming. Going into the weekend, as much as 6 to 12
inches of snow will be possible for these areas. Elsewhere, there
will be a new upper-level trough impacting the Pacific Northwest
going into the weekend which will bring some locally heavy rain
for the coastal ranges and snowfall for the Cascades. In fact,
portions of the Washington and Oregon Cascades may see as much as
1 to 2 feet of new snowfall going through Saturday.

The aforementioned area of deepening low pressure over the High
Plains will drive a strong quasi-stationary front that will tend
to be draped from the lower Missouri Valley eastward through the
Ohio Valley and the Mid-Atlantic region. Low pressure over western
Kansas on Friday will deepen on its way across the Midwest through
Saturday and will allow a portion of this front to surge north as
a warm front as a cold front finally ejects east out of the
Rockies and across the central and southern Plains. Both of these
fronts will become a focus for heavy showers and thunderstorms in
time, and there will be a threat of severe weather from portions
of the lower and middle Mississippi Valley east into the Ohio
Valley as the low center ejects out of the Plains Friday and
Saturday.

Meanwhile, a critical fire weather threat exists across the
central and southern High Plains and also the southern Rockies
through Saturday as locally strong winds, very warm temperatures,
and low relative humidities are expected across these areas. In
fact, temperatures across the southern U.S. to the south of the
front draped from the Plains to the Mid-Atlantic will see well
above average temperatures, with readings as much as 15 to 25
degrees above normal. Many of these areas can expect high
temperatures in the 80s to near 90 degrees ahead of the
approaching cold front."

A rapidly intensifying low pressure system is forecast to bring
unsettled weather from across the central portion of the country
to the Great Lakes and the Northeast as we head into the weekend. 
Another deep upper-level trough is currently spreading mountain
snow showers and lower-elevation rain across the southwestern U.S.
early this morning.  As the upper-level trough moves eastward
today, a low pressure system is forecast to intensify over the
central High Plains.  This will lead to a higher chance of snow to
move into the central Rockies later today while rain and
thunderstorms expand eastward through the central Plains and the
Ohio Valley toward the Mid-Atlantic.  As the storm intensify
further tonight, a period of heavy snow together with strong gusty
winds could impact the central High Plains into the central
Rockies early on Saturday before the low pressure system gradually
moves away toward the upper Midwest Saturday night.  An extended
area of rain is expected to be focused along and to the north of a
stationary front well to the east of the low pressure center. 
Heavy rain will likely lead to flooding concerns across the Ohio
Valley through tonight.

As the storm intensifies and heads toward the upper Midwest, a
wind-driven cold rain is expected to spread across the central
Plains on Saturday.  Some of the rain could change over to wet
snow Saturday night across the upper Midwest before ending.  South
of the intensifying storm, showers and thunderstorms ahead of a
strong cold front are expected to move quickly across the southern
Plains through Saturday, reaching the Mississippi Valley on
Sunday.  Elsewhere, there will be a new upper-level trough
impacting the Pacific Northwest going into the weekend which will
bring some locally heavy rain for the coastal ranges and snowfall
for the Cascades. In fact, portions of the Washington and Oregon
Cascades may see as much as 1 to 2 feet of new snowfall going
through Saturday.

Meanwhile, fire weather threat remains at critical levels through
Saturday across the southern to central High Plains and southern
Rockies as locally strong winds, very warm temperatures, and low
relative humidities are expected across these areas in the wake of
the intensifying storm. In fact, temperatures across the southern

A rapidly intensifying low pressure system is forecast to bring
unsettled weather from the Nation's Heartland to the Great Lakes
and Northeast as we head into the weekend. A potent upper-level
trough is currently generating mountain snow showers and
lower-elevation rain across the Four Corners region early this
afternoon. As the upper-level trough moves eastward today, a low
pressure system will intensify over the central High Plains. On
the western side of this storm system, accumulating snowfall is
likely along the front range of the Central Rockies as well as
eastern Colorado, southeast Wyoming, and western Nebraska tonight
and into Saturday morning. East of the storm, rain and
thunderstorms should expand eastward through the Midwest and
towards the Ohio Valley this evening and into Saturday. Excessive
rainfall is possible in this swath of the country with a Slight
Risk for flash flooding in place through tonight. In addition,
severe weather is anticipated tonight from the Southern Plains
along the dryline and ahead of an approaching cold front to the
Midwest as a warm front lifts northward across the region tonight.
By Saturday a heightened threat for severe weather, including the
threat for tornadoes, is possible in portions of the Midwest, Ohio
Valley, and Lower Mississippi Valley. In fact, the SPC has issued
a Moderate Risk for severe weather in extreme southeast Iowa and
northern Illinois on Saturday.

As the storm intensifies over the Midwest on Saturday, a
wind-driven cold rain is expected to spread across the central
Plains on Saturday. Some of the rain could change over to wet snow
Saturday night across the upper Midwest before tapering off by
Sunday morning. South of the intensifying storm, showers and
thunderstorms ahead of a strong cold front are expected to move
quickly across the southern Plains through Saturday, reaching the
Mississippi Valley on Sunday. The storm system will usher showers
to the Northeast and a wintry mix to northern New England on
Sunday before a new coastal storm takes shape off the New England
coast by Monday morning. Elsewhere, a new upper-level trough is
forecast to impact the Pacific Northwest going into the weekend
which will bring locally heavy rain to the coastal ranges. The
Cascades will brace for heavy snow with as much as 1 to 2 feet of
new snowfall going through Sunday night.

Meanwhile, fire weather threat remains at critical levels through
Saturday across the southern to central High Plains and southern
Rockies as locally strong winds, very warm temperatures, and low
relative humidities are expected across these areas in the wake of
the intensifying storm. In fact, temperatures across the southern
U.S. to the Mid-Atlantic will see well above average temperatures,

A rapidly intensifying low pressure system is forecast to bring
unsettled weather from the Nation's Heartland to the Great Lakes
and Northeast through the weekend. An energetic upper-level trough
is currently generating mountain snow showers and lower-elevation
rain across the Four Corners region early this morning as a low
pressure system begins to intensify over the central High Plains. 
Rain across the front range of the central Rockies is in the
process of changing over to snow.  Accumulating snowfall is likely
today across eastern Colorado before the low pressure system moves
further away toward the upper Midwest tonight.  As the storm
continues to intensify, it will bring a wind-driven cold rain
through the central Plains today into the evening.  By early on
Sunday, the rain across northern Minnesota into the upper Great
Lakes is expected to change over to wet snow.

Meanwhile, rain and thunderstorms will continue to expand eastward
through the Midwest and the Ohio Valley into the Mid-Atlantic
ahead of a warm front today, before spreading into New England as
a steady rain on Sunday. In addition, severe weather is possible
through tonight from the Mid-Mississippi Valley to the Midwest and
across much of the Ohio Valley ahead of an approaching cold front.
 The most likely area of seeing severe weather is expected to be
across northern Illinois per the Storm Prediction Center as the
triple-point of the fronts associated with the low pressure system
approaches.

Across the Mid-Atlantic, morning rain should give way to a very
warm afternoon for the southern portion of the area following the
passage of a warm front with temperatures more than 20 degrees
above normal across the central Appalachians.  By tonight, the
rain is expected to spread into New England.  By later on Sunday,
wintry precipitation is expected to develop over northern New
England where snow and frozen precipitation accumulations are
expected, as a new coastal storm takes shape off the New England
coast by Monday morning. This new low will likely keep a good
chance of snow into Monday across northern New England.

Elsewhere, the next upper-level trough is forecast to impact the
Pacific Northwest through the weekend which will bring locally
heavy rain to the coastal ranges. The Cascades will brace for
heavy snow with as much as 1 to 2 feet of new snowfall going
through Sunday night before the next front arrives on Monday with
a new round of heavy precipitation.

Meanwhile, fire weather threat remains at critical levels for
today into Sunday across the southern to central High Plains into

A powerful storm system in the Nation's Heartland is forecast to
produce several weather hazards this this evening including severe
weather, flash flooding, winter weather, and strong winds
conducive for critical fire weather conditions. As the storm
intensifies this afternoon, dangerous thunderstorms are expected
to rapidly develop with the potential for tornadoes, large hail,
and damaging winds in portions of the Midwest, the Mid-South, and
Lower Great Lakes. On the northern edge of the storm, the Upper
Mississippi Valley may receive up to a few inches of snow
overnight. Farther east, excessive rainfall could lead to flash
flooding across the Lower Great Lakes and northern Mid-Atlantic.
By Sunday morning, both the severe and flash flood threats will
lessen but a few strong to severe thunderstorms are possible in
the eastern Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic. Showers along with
cooler and dreary conditions will be common in the Northeast while
portions of northern New England receive accumulating snowfall.
Snow totals in portions of northern Maine may exceed 6 inches with
less snowfall closer to the coast.

In wake of this storm system, blustery conditions combined with
low relative humidity levels will set the stage for a heightened
risk for fire weather in the southern High Plains. The Rio Grande
River Valley in particular is under a critical risk for fire
weather potential this afternoon. In addition, drier conditions
will arrive across the Mississippi and Ohio River Valleys Sunday
while the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast bask in well above normal
temperatures. High temperatures will soar into the 80s from
Virginia on south to the Southeast and Gulf Coasts. This taste of
summer-like warmth will be short lived as below normal
temperatures over the Great Lakes Monday push into most southern
and eastern regions by Tuesday.

Out west, an upper-level trough will take its time tracking east
as it looks to stay a few days over the Pacific Northwest and
British Columbia. This makes for a cool and wet stretch of weather
across the region. This pattern is also favorable for dropping
heavy snowfall in the Cascades, Blue, Bitterroot, Sawtooth, and
Teton Mountain ranges. The Cascades most notably will be measuring
snow in feet through mid-week. Meanwhile, neighbors in the
Southwest will be mostly dry but cool through Monday before a
warming trend gets started on Tuesday."

A strong low pressure system currently moving across the upper
Midwest is responsible for gusty winds and areas of wet snow
across portions Minnesota while scattered heavy rain and severe
thunderstorms sweep across areas to the east of the Mississippi
Valley.  The storm is expected to gradually weaken over the Great
Lakes as a new storm center is forecast to intensify south of Long
Island tonight. Wintry precipitation well ahead of the storm will
overspread northern New England by tonight.  The old storm center
will continue to weaken but will be slow to move across the lower
Great Lakes as the new storm center continues to intensify off the
New England coast.  This will likely result in wintry
precipitation lingering over New England into Tuesday. Snowfall
totals over northern Maine will likely exceed 6 inches by Tuesday.

As the strong storm system moves into the Northeast, the fire
weather threat over the southern High Plains is expected to lessen
today. However, a new low pressure system is forecast to form over
the southern Plains early next week.  Drier and windier conditions
behind the storm will once again raise the fire risk over the
southern Plains by Monday.  The same storm will once again feed
moisture from the Gulf into the Deep South.  The threat of heavy
rain can be expected to increase from the southern Plains to the
lower Mississippi Valley on Monday and continue into Tuesday ahead
of a warm front.

Meanwhile, very warm weather is expected this afternoon from
Virginia southward into the Southeast as temperatures soar into
the 80s. However, this taste of summer will be short-lived as
below normal temperatures over the Great Lakes on Monday will push
into the East Coast by Tuesday.

Out west, an upper-level trough will take a few days to track
across the Pacific Northwest and British Columbia. This makes for
a cool and unsettled weather pattern across the region. This
pattern is also favorable for dropping heavy snowfall in the
Cascades, Blue, Bitterroot, Sawtooth, and Teton Mountain ranges.
The Cascades most notably will be measuring snow in feet through

The storm system responsible for Saturday's episodes of severe
weather and flash flooding in portions of the Mississippi and Ohio
Valleys will track through the Great Lakes this evening. A cold
front tracking across the South and Mid-Atlantic will usher in
cooler temperatures and drier conditions on Monday. Meanwhile,
showers and thunderstorms will track across the Mid-Atlantic and
southern New England tonight while northern Maine witnesses
measurable snowfall. The snow in northern New England is a result
of a developing coastal low east of the Massachusetts Capes.
Portions of northern Maine can expect over 6 inches of snow
tonight before the snow tapers off Monday night. In wake of this
storm system, a coastal front will push south from southern New
England Tuesday to the Mid-Atlantic on Wednesday forcing cooler
temperatures to stick around through mid-week.

In the West, a northeast Pacific storm will roll into the
Northwest on Monday bringing widespread showers and mountain snow
to the Pacific Northwest, northern Great Basin, and Northern
Rockies. The Cascades will measure snowfall in feet through
mid-week while interior mountain ranges such as the Bitterroots,
Sawtooths, and Tetons also pickup heavy snow. In addition, a cold
frontal passage will lead to colder temperatures across the
Northwest Monday night and lasting into the middle of the week.

Farther south, an upper-level disturbance will track across the
Southwest Monday morning. Ahead of this feature, an area of low
pressure will form in the southern High Plains Monday afternoon.
The developing storm system will tap into Gulf moisture leading to

...Pacific storm to make for a wet and wintry start to the week in
the Northwest...

...Low pressure system lingering over the Northeast expected to
bring additional snowfall for northern New England...

...Developing area of low pressure expected to spread heavy rain
and thunderstorms quickly across the Deep South to the Southeast...

Quite an active weather pattern is expected for the next few days
as three major systems are expected to affect many parts of the
country.  The low pressure system responsible for widespread
precipiation from the Great Lakes to the Northeast will weaken
very slowly as it lingers over the Northeast for the next couple
of days.  This will keep a good chance of snow across northern New
England through Wednesday morning where a few inches of additional
accumulations can be expected.  A cold front behind an
intensifying storm off the New England coast will usher in cooler
temperatures and drier conditions through much of the eastern U.S.
today.  This storm system will also push a back door cold front
down from New England into the Mid-Atlantic on Tuesday as rain
ahead of a low pressure system from the Deep South quickly moves
into the Southeast and the Mid-Atlantic by Tuesday evening.  This
low pressure system is currently developing over the southern High
Plains as an upper-level disturbance tracks across the Southwest. 
The storm will tap into Gulf moisture leading to a blossoming of
showers and thunderstorms from the southern Plains Monday evening
to the lower Mississippi Valley some time Monday night with a good
chance for a quick round of heavy rain.  By Tuesday, the storm
will advance rapidly into the Southeast where heavy showers and a
threat of severe thunderstorms are possible.  By Wednesday
morning, the storm center should continue to move rapidly off the
Southeast U.S. coast, ending the rain over the Southeast.  Farther
north, some rain should linger over the Mid-Atlantic and the Ohio
Valley near a surface trough.

In the West, a northeast Pacific storm will roll into the
Northwest on today, bringing widespread showers and mountain snow
to the Pacific Northwest, northern Great Basin, and Northern
Rockies. The Cascades will measure snowfall in feet through
mid-week while interior mountain ranges such as the Bitterroots,
Sawtooths, and Tetons also pickup heavy snow. In addition, a cold
frontal passage will lead to colder temperatures across the
Northwest Monday night and lasting into the middle of the week."

Tuesday...

...Below average temperatures for the Pacific Northwest and much

...Heavy snows likely through the Cascades and into the Northern
Rockies.  Light snows possible from northern New York State into
northern New England...

Active weather expected ahead of an area of low pressure forecast
to move east from the Southern Plains into the Lower Mississippi
Valley tonight and across the Southeast on Tuesday.  Thunderstorms
are expected to continue to enhance late this afternoon across the
Southern Plains, moving into the Lower Mississippi Valley tonight.
 These storms will likely produce heavy rains and the potential
for localized flash flooding.  This heavy rain potential will
continue on Tuesday across the Southeast, Southern Appalachians
and Southern Mid Atlantic as the storm moves eastward.  In
addition, severe thunderstorms may affect portions of the
Southeast from southern Alabama, Southern Georgia, far northern
Florida into far southern South Carolina.

Large portions of the country over the next two days will be in a
cool spring weather pattern as upper level lows are anchored
across the Pacific Northwest/southwest Canada and over the
Northeast.  These upper lows will keep temperatures below average
from the Pacific Northwest, Northern Rockies and into the northern
High Plains and across much of the east.  The exception will be
along the Gulf coast into Florida where much above average
temperatures will continue Tuesday before cooler temperatures move
in behind a cold front on Wednesday.  Above average temperatures
also likely from southern California, through the Southwest and
across much of Plains over the next two days.

In addition to the closed upper lows supporting below average
temperatures, they will also support heavy snows from the Cascades
of Washington & Oregon into the Northern Rockies.  Snow totals
over the next two days may be in the 1 to 2 foot range across
those areas.  Much lighter snows are also possible across northern
New York State and northern New England where 1 to 3 inches are
possible."

A fast-moving low pressure system moving across the Deep South
will bring a quick round of heavy rain and the potential of severe
weather through the Southeast today into tonight.  The rain will
exit the Southeast U.S. coast later tonight but a period of heavy
rain with increasing winds could clip the eastern shores of North
Carolina early on Wednesday as the low pressure system is expected
to intensify into a massive storm off the East Coast.  This storm
will also be very expansive in size and will have some influence
in keeping light amounts of wet snow across northern New England
through Thursday morning.

Large portions of the country over the next two days will be in a
cool spring weather pattern as upper level lows are anchored
across the Pacific Northwest/southwest Canada and over the
Northeast.  These upper lows will keep temperatures below average
from the Pacific Northwest, northern Rockies and into the northern

exception will be along the Gulf coast into Florida where much
above average temperatures will continue Tuesday before cooler
temperatures move in behind a cold front on Wednesday.  Above
average temperatures also likely from southern California, through
the Southwest and across much of Plains over the next two days.

Following the departure of the low pressure system across the
Southeast into the Atlantic on Wednesday, the focus of active
weather will shift to the northwestern U.S. where the
aforementioned cold upper lows will support heavy snow along the
Cascades of Washington & Oregon into much of the higher elevations
of the northern Rockies.  Snow totals over the next two days may
be in the 1 to 2 foot range across these areas.  By Wednesday
night into Thursday, a complex interaction of the upper lows with
cold air intrusion from Canada will result in an increasing threat
of snow expanding eastward from the northern High Plains toward
the upper Midwest."

...Severe weather possible through tonight in the Southeast...

...Heavy snows and cold temperatures will spread from the
Northwest into the Northern Plains over the next couple of days...

A surface low pressure system will continue moving eastward
quickly across the Southeast this afternoon and tonight, and
severe weather is possible in its vicinity. The Storm Prediction
Center has outlooked a Slight Risk of severe weather across
northern Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. As the low tracks
into the Atlantic, it should sweep a cold front across Florida,
tempering the much above normal temperatures there. The low is
expected to strengthen rapidly, but remain fairly far offshore in
the Atlantic. Nevertheless, rain and windy conditions could
continue over the Outer Banks of North Carolina due to this low
through Wednesday, and rain and wet snow is possible over New
England through Thursday from the influence of this low.

Active weather is expected for the Northwest as frontal systems
make their way through across the area. These fronts and the
upper-level low above should also cause much below normal
temperatures there.  Widespread precipitation will thus fall
mainly in the form of snow except in the lowest elevations in the
Northwest over the next couple of days. As the fronts and upper
low progress eastward, snow is forecast for the Dakotas into
western Nebraska by Thursday. Snowfall amounts should be over a
foot in higher elevations of the Cascades, Northern Rockies, Wind
River Mountains/Tetons, and Big Horn Mountains. Much of the
Northern High Plains should receive generally 2 to 6 inches of
snow, with higher amounts in the Black Hills.

Ahead of the cold front, above normal temperatures are expected in
the Southwest to Southern/Central Plains and part of the
Mississippi Valley. Meanwhile, the Eastern Seaboard will remain
somewhat cooler than normal with generally northerly winds.
Showers and thunderstorms could form on Thursday east of the cold
front and a developing dryline across the Southern/Central Plains
and the Mississippi Valley."

later in the morning...

...A large ocean storm will keep rainy and windy weather across
New England into Friday...

A low pressure system will continue to rapidly deepen as it move
quickly off the North Carolina coast this morning, ending the rain
with subsiding winds across the region.  This low pressure system
is forecast to develop into a huge ocean storm while meandering
off the East Coast for the next few days.  Wet snow over northern
Maine is expected to taper off later today as the storm
intensifies further over the Atlantic.  However, with a highly
amplified and blocky synoptic pattern across the higher latitudes,
rainy and windy conditions are expected to move back into New
England from the east on Thursday and continue into Friday as the
massive ocean storm is forecast to retrograde.  High surfs and
some beach erosion are also possible along the coast.

Meanwhile, active weather is expected to progress rather slowly
across the Northwest into the northern Plains for the next two
days under a slow-moving upper level vortex.  Multiple
disturbances within this vortex will interact with an intrusion of
cold air from western Canada.  This complex interaction will
continue to result in heavy snow along the Cascades and portions
of the northern Rockies followed by an increasing chance of snow
expanding northeastward across the northern Plains on Thursday and
into Friday behind a cold front. A swath of mixed precipitation
can also be expected preceding the snow from the northern Plains
into the upper Midwest. Much below normal temperatures are
expected under this weather pattern from the northern Rockies and
gradually spreading across the northern Plains.

Ahead of the cold front, above normal temperatures are expected in
the Southwest to southern/central Plains and parts of the
Mississippi Valley. Meanwhile, the Eastern Seaboard will have cool
afternoons and near normal temperatures in the mornings with
generally northerly winds under the influence of the western
periphery of the huge ocean storm."

...Rain and scattered thunderstorms expected for the
Southern/Central Plains and Mississippi Valley...

...Wet and windy weather will persist over the Northeast due to a

Over the next couple of days, a strong cold front is expected to
move slowly eastward across the Northern Plains and into the Upper
Midwest, and southeastward across the Central/Southern Rockies and
Central/Southern Plains. Behind this front, temperatures are
forecast to fall much below average across the Northern Rockies to
Northern/Central Plains. These cold conditions will support snow
in these areas. Snowfall amounts of 6 to 12 inches are forecast
for parts of Wyoming and South Dakota into northeastern North
Dakota and northwestern Minnesota. As the cold front passes, rain
could change to sleet or freezing rain before transitioning to
snow. Freezing rain accumulations of over a tenth of an inch are
expected in eastern portions of the Dakotas and western Minnesota.

Along and ahead of the cold front, and ahead of a dryline in the
Southern High Plains, rain and scattered thunderstorms are
expected for portions of the Plains and Mississippi Valley.
Rainfall totals will generally be light, but amounts over an inch
are possible through Friday for central Texas. Behind the dryline,
elevated to critical fire weather conditions are forecast by the
Storm Prediction Center for the Southern High Plains. Warmer than
average temperatures are likely ahead of the cold front.

A deep surface low pressure system is forecast to meander over the
western Atlantic over the next couple of days. Though far
offshore, the enormity of the low will mean the Northeast will
remain under the influence of the low; through Friday, rain and
even some light wet snow in higher elevations are possible for the
Northeast. Windy conditions along with high surf, beach erosion,
and coastal flooding are possible."

...Chance of heavy rain increases over central and eastern Texas

A blocking pattern developing in the higher latitudes will lead to
rather atypical progressions of weather systems across the U.S.
for the next few days.  First of all, a large and intense low
pressure system that has moved off the Mid-Atlantic coast
yesterday is forecast to retrograde, or move back closer toward
the East Coast during the next couple of days.  This will increase
the chance of strong gusty winds along with rain to spread from
east to west across New England today into Friday as a back door
warm front from the Canadian Maritimes sweeps across the region. 
It appears that the storm will edge closer toward New England than
earlier forecasts.  Therefore, coastal sections will be more
likely to be impacted by high winds, flooding, high surf and
possibly beach erosion.  Over the interior sections near the
Canadian border, temperatures are expected to be cold enough to
support wet snow and mixed precipitation.  The storm center is
forecast to make its closest approach to Cape Cod Friday morning
before gradually pulling back out to sea.  Winds and rain are
expected to slowly taper off later on Friday, and may end by
Saturday morning.

Meanwhile on the other side of the country, a strong cold front is
expected to move slowly eastward across the northern Plains and
into the upper Midwest as a broad upper-level vortex interacts
with a surge of cold air from western Canada. Behind this front,
temperatures are forecast to fall much below average across the
northern Rockies to northern and central Plains. A swath of
accumulating snow is expected today from the northern Rockies to
North Dakota. By Friday, the snow should be confined to northern
Minnesota into northern Wisconsin where more than 6 inches of
accumulation is possible. In addition, freezing rain is expected
to precede the snow from the eastern portions of the Dakotas into
western Minnesota.

Along and ahead of the cold front, rain and scattered
thunderstorms are expected for portions of the Plains and down
into the Mississippi Valley. Rainfall totals will generally be
light today, but amounts over an inch are possible on Friday into
early Saturday for central and eastern Texas as moisture from the
Gulf is drawn northward ahead of the strong front.  Behind the
front, elevated to critical fire weather conditions are forecast
by the Storm Prediction Center for the southern High Plains.
Warmer than average temperatures are likely ahead of the cold
front."

...Chance of heavy rain increases over central and eastern Texas

As previously noted, frontal progressions across the U.S. and the
surrounding waters will be atypical over the next few days as a
result of a higher latitude blocking pattern. For the Northeast, a
Nor'easter will retrograde toward the coast sending a warm front
westward through New England. Rain along with a wintry mix in the
higher terrain will spread toward the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley
region. Higher tides, strong winds and coastal flooding is also
expected with this feature.

A strong cold front will slowly progress through the Northern
Plains and widespread snow and wintry precipitation will accompany
it across the north-central U.S. Cold Canadian air will filter
into the region behind the front, bringing temperatures to
well-below average for early April. Numerous Winter Weather
Advisories and Winter Storm Warnings are in effect from Colorado
to Minnesota. Freezing rain is expected from the eastern portions
of the Dakotas into western Minnesota before changing over to all
snow. Many areas across northern Minnesota and northern Wisconsin
could have accumulations of 6 or more inches of snow.

Rain and thunderstorms is expected across the Plains and
Mississippi Valley along and ahead of this strong cold front.
Rainfall amounts and intensities will be the greatest over
portions of central and eastern Texas as this region will have a
nearly continuous feed of Gulf moisture into the frontal boundary.
WPC has highlighted this part of the state as having a Marginal
Risk for Excessive Rainfall through Saturday. The storm Prediction
Center has noted this same general area as having a Slight Risk
for severe weather and there is critical fire weather across most
of New Mexico and extreme western Texas"

A powerful nor'easter off the East Coast will continue impact the
New England coast with blustery conditions, heavy showers, high
surf, and coastal flooding through this morning and into the early
evening hours. Scattered showers are also possible across much of
the Northeast but with less punch than what is expected for
coastal New England. Look for showers to taper off Friday night as
the nor'easter heads south and east into the northwest Atlantic
and high pressure builds in from the west. By Saturday, mostly dry
conditions and more a more seasonal temperature regime looks to
settle in across the region.

A strong cold front continues to inch its way across the Midwest
this morning. The front's slow progression combined with the
plummeting temperatures in its wake is causing post-frontal
precipitation to fall in the form of freezing rain from the
Central Plains to the Upper Midwest. Winter Storm Warnings and
Advisories continue through this morning as icy accumulations
ranging between a tenth to two tenths of an inch of ice are
possible, thus making for slick travel conditions in these
regions. Meanwhile, the cold front will march south in the
Southern Plains where it is expected to trigger showers and
thunderstorms this afternoon and evening. Some thunderstorms in
southern and central Texas could be severe with the potential to
produce strong winds and large hail. Thunderstorms will also
contain intense rainfall rates that could lead to localized flash
flooding in the central and eastern portions of the Lone Star
State.

Yet another Pacific storm system will take aim at the West Coast
this weekend. Coastal and valley rain is possible from Oregon to
the Bay Area of California Saturday with heavy snow in the Oregon
Cascades and the Sierra Nevada. The Sierras, in particular, will
likely measure over 1 to 2 feet of snow by the end of the weekend.
Southern California will wait until Sunday for periods of rain to
reach the region with locally heavy amounts possible."

Rain and thunderstorms are expected for Texas through the weekend,
but particularly tonight into Saturday as a cold front slowly
moves across the state. Locally heavy rain causing flash flooding
as well as severe weather, especially potentially large hail in
southern Texas, are possible. There are Slight Risks in place for
both the severe and flash flooding hazards through Saturday
morning.

Farther north, the strong cold front will continue moving eastward
across the Upper Midwest, bringing some light additional snow and
freezing rain totals behind it, but the bulk of the winter weather
has finished in the north-central tier. Colder than normal
temperatures are likely for the central U.S. again on Saturday,
but the cold front should weaken considerably by Sunday as it
loses upper-level support.

A couple of potent upper-level lows approaching the West Coast
will bring precipitation to the Pacific Northwest, California, and
into the Great Basin through the weekend. Rain is expected for
lower elevations with snow for higher elevations. Snowfall amounts
will be largest in the Sierra Nevada and Shastas, with over a foot
or two of snow forecast there. Rain should begin in Southern
California Sunday, and there is a possibility of localized
flooding there particularly over burn scars. Colder than average
temperatures are also expected in the West.

The large Atlantic low pressure system is forecast to move
eastward tonight into Saturday. This evening and tonight, showers
could continue over the Northeast, along with windy conditions and
the potential for coastal flooding in the Mid-Atlantic region.
These conditions should end early Saturday as the low moves
farther offshore."

A potent cold front sweeping across south Texas and into northern
Mexico early this morning will help to diminish the severe threat
on Saturday. However, persistent southwesterly flow aloft with
embedded upper level disturbances will aid in additional showers
and thunderstorms throughout the from central and southern Texas
to Arkansas and Louisiana. Rainfall rates could be high within
heavier showers and thunderstorms and may promote the threat for
localized flash flooding in parts of south Texas. Shower and
thunderstorm activity is expected to taper off Saturday night with
only a few stray showers and thunderstorms possible across Texas
on Sunday and into Sunday night.

The next weather headliner will be a deep and anomalous upper
trough that will slam into California this weekend. Through
Monday, rainfall totals in the valleys and coastal areas of Oregon
and California will ranger between 1 to as much as 3 inches. In
the higher elevations snow will start to fall in the Sierra Nevada
on Saturday, then fall and accumulate at a rapid pace on Sunday.
Heavy snow will continue into Monday and begin to gradually taper
off Monday night. By Tuesday morning, portions of the Sierra
Nevada are forecast to receive anywhere from 1 to as much as 4
feet of snow with locally higher amounts possible in the highest
elevations. In addition to the heavy precipitation totals,
temperatures are likely to remain below normal throughout the
weekend and into the start of the upcoming week.

The nor'easter that has generated heavy showers, strong wind
gusts, and coastal flooding is heading east deeper into the
northwest Atlantic this morning. This should make for drier
conditions along much of the East Coast Saturday with seasonally
mild temperatures on tap. Further west, the Plains will start out
the weekend on a cool note but moderating temperatures are likely
to take shape on Sunday. By Monday, temperatures from the front
range of the Rockies to the East Coast are forecast to feel more
like May than early April. Temperatures will only continue to warm

move into California. This will provide support for precipitation
as it pulls in Pacific moisture. Lower elevation rain and higher
elevation snow is likely for much of the West. The highest
snowfall totals are forecast for the Sierra Nevada--where multiple
feet of snow are likely and Winter Storm Warnings are in effect.
Meanwhile, the Shastas and the Wind River Mountains/Tetons could
see several inches of snow. As rain takes aim at Southern
California beginning Sunday, rainfall amounts could cause
flooding/flash flooding problems early next week. This is
particularly a concern over burn scars.

Farther east, rain showers and a few thunderstorms are expected
once again across Texas. These could produce locally heavy rain
through this evening, which could cause isolated flooding concerns
particularly over southern Texas, especially over areas that have
received quite a bit of rain over the last couple days. Showers
are also possible along a weakening cold front moving across the
Ohio Valley tonight and the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic Sunday.
Rainfall totals will be very light with these showers.

Temperature-wise, the upper-level low approaching California will
produce much below normal temperatures over California and Nevada.
High temperatures are also forecast to be a few degrees below
average in the Northwest. Meanwhile, temperatures should moderate
and warm quite a bit over much of the Plains through Monday as
upper-level ridging builds. Highs in the 70s are forecast as far
north as South Dakota by Monday. The East can expect high

California is feeling the initial affects of an intensifying storm
system off the West Coast this morning with heavy showers tracking
through portions of central California. This is only the start of
what will be a busy Sunday as copious amounts of Pacific moisture
stream out ahead of the storm this morning. In the Sierras, snow
will accumulate in a hurry as snow falls fast and furious up and
down the mountain range today and into Monday. Snow will be
measured in feet while the combination of heavy snow and gusty
winds lead to treacherous travel and whiteout conditions.
Meanwhile, rain will all heavily at times, especially for those
along the coastal range and the Southern California mountain
ranges. Rainfall totals are forecast to exceed 3 inches in the
higher elevations with locally higher amounts possible. Even lower
elevation areas will see plenty of rain with urbanized flooding
possible. Moderate and Slight risks for excessive rainfall are in
place for portions of Southern California today and a Slight risk
remains in place for far Southern California on Monday. Look for
conditions to improve state-wide by Tuesday morning, although
abnormally cool temperatures will remain in the forecast on
Tuesday.

While temperatures stay cool along the West Coast, folks from the
front range of the Rockies to the East Coast will warm up through
the first half of the week. Temperature anomalies in the Midwest
will jump to 10 to 15 degrees above normal by Tuesday with daytime
highs soaring into the 80s. To the south, temperatures in the
upper 60s and low 70s in the Deep South could tie or break daily
record warm low temperatures Tuesday morning and continuing into

spring-like temperatures with the lone exception being New England
as a cold front drops their temperatures seasonally cooler levels
by mid-week. Spring lovers in the central and eastern regions will
want to enjoy this stretch of warmer weather while they can as
cooler temperatures are forecast to return the second half of the

The return of warmer temperatures in the Midwest and across the
Gulf Coast will also mean a chance for spotty showers and
thunderstorms late in the day on Monday. As a warm front in the
the Mississippi Valley lifts east towards the Ohio Valley and

An anomalously deep upper-level low is forecast to continue moving
southward just offshore of California for the beginning of the

moisture stream in. Heavy rain is possible in lower elevations of
coastal California and into the valleys. This could cause flooding

concern; the chance may lessen some by Monday, but there remains a
Slight Risk of excessive rainfall outlooked then. Meanwhile in
higher elevations of the Sierra Nevada, snow will continue to

multiple feet of snow through Monday. The Great
Basin/Intermountain West can also expect precipitation with

through Monday. Furthermore, windy conditions and colder than
normal temperatures are expected for California into parts of the
Southwest.

Farther east, areas from the Southern Plains to Mississippi Valley
to the Eastern Seaboard could see scattered showers and
thunderstorms over the next couple days. Rainfall chances should
ramp up for the Ohio Valley Monday and especially into Tuesday
with a warm front in the vicinity, and rainfall of an inch is
possible in some areas, which could cause localized flooding
problems. Severe weather will also be a concern--the Storm
Prediction Center has outlooked a Slight Risk of severe weather
for a good portion of the Ohio Valley on Tuesday.

While the West will be experiencing cooler than average
temperatures, temperatures from the Rockies eastward are forecast
to warm quite a bit for the early part of the week. The most
anomalous warmth can be expected for the Central Plains and
portions of the Midwest Monday and Tuesday, with high temperatures
nearing 70 as far north as South Dakota and Minnesota, 15 to 20
degrees above average. High temperatures around 10 degrees above
normal will be widespread from the Gulf Coast to the Great Lakes
and east to the Eastern Seaboard."

An exceptionally deep upper-level low is forecast to spend the
first half of the week near Southern California with the worst
impacts expected to be felt today. This morning, heavy snow
continues to fall in the southern Sierra Nevada as well as the San
Gabriel and San Bernadino mountain ranges. In addition, heavy rain
is falling along the coastal range and in the valleys. The risk
for flooding and flash flooding in some areas, particularly over
burn scars, and runoff is possible in urbanized areas as well. A
Slight Risk of excessive rainfall remains in place for portions of
Southern California into this afternoon as the heaviest rainfall
pushes south towards San Diego. Farther west, the Great
Basin/Intermountain West can also expect precipitation as the
frontal system slowly advances inland today and Tuesday. The Wind
River Mountains/Tetons are forecast may also pick up several
inches of snow through Monday and into early Tuesday. Furthermore,
windy conditions and colder than normal temperatures are expected
for California into parts of the Southwest.

Heading east, areas from the Southern Plains and Midwest to the
Eastern Seaboard should see scattered showers and thunderstorms
flare up over the next couple days. Monday could feature potential
severe weather in the Lower Great Lakes and southern Mid-Atlantic
with a more organized threat for severe weather in the Ohio Valley
on Tuesday. Flash flooding will also be a potential concern in
these regions through Tuesday. By Wednesday the severe threat
shifts to the Mid-South and persists in the Mid-Atlantic.

While the West experiences cooler than average temperatures, most
locations from the foothills of the Rockies to the East Coast will
encounter above normal temperatures. By Tuesday, high temperatures
will hover around 80 degrees in parts of the Plains, Midwest, and
much of the South. Portions of the Mid-Atlantic may see high
temperatures make a run at 80 degrees on Wednesday. The run of
above normal temperatures appears to be short lived though as a
potent cold front ushers in below normal temperatures to the
eastern two-thirds of the Lower 48 the second half of the week."

An anomalously deep upper-level low is forecast to meander in the
eastern Pacific offshore of California, eventually making its way
into the Southwest late Wednesday. This and plenty of available
moisture will continue to cause precipitation over much of
California and into the Southwest and Great Basin. With persistent
heavy rain expected in southern parts of California, flooding and
flash flooding are possible, especially over burn scars but in
urbanized areas as well. Slight Risks of excessive rainfall are in
place over the next few days to outline this threat. Additionally,
snow is forecast to continue especially over southern portions of
the Sierra Nevada as well as the San Bernadino and San Gabriel
Mountains.

Farther east, showers and thunderstorms are possible in the
eastern half of the nation through Wednesday. Storms are expected
to focus near and south of a warm front located in the Ohio Valley
to Mid-Atlantic today, pushing northward toward the Great Lakes on
Tuesday. The Storm Prediction Center has outlined a large Slight
Risk area for potential severe weather on Tuesday for much of the
Ohio Valley into the Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic, after Marginal
Risks today. Some localized high rainfall totals could cause flash
flooding concerns there as well. Then, ahead of an approaching
cold front, severe weather could be a hazard for the Tennessee
Valley and Lower Ohio Valley on Wednesday. Elsewhere, there is an
Elevated to Critical fire weather threat over the Southern/Central
High Plains through Tuesday, where downslope winds and low
humidities will combine.

Temperatures are forecast to remain quite warm from the Rockies
eastward again on Tuesday. High temperatures of 15 to 20 degrees
above normal are likely from the Central Plains to the Midwest,
with highs near 80 degrees. The Northern Plains is expected to
cool down by Wednesday as a cold front moves through, and the
Northeast will cool down Wednesday as well, but much of the rest
of the nation will stay warm. Highs in the upper 80s on Wednesday
could be close to records across the Lower Mississippi Valley and
Gulf Coast. Meanwhile, the low upper-level heights should keep
temperatures cool for the southern half of California into
portions of the Southwest through the period; highs 15 to 25
degrees below average are expected there."

An anomalously deep upper-level low will be in no rush to leave
Southwest over the next few days. The resulting weather through
week's end will be wet, cool and breezy. Today the upper low will
continue to pump Pacific moisture into Southern California
generating areas of rain and more mountain snow. There is a slight
risk for excessive rainfall in portions of Southern California and
Winter Storm Warnings remain in effect for the San Gabriel and San
Bernadino mountain ranges. Wednesday should be more of the same in
southern California with yet another round of valley/desert rain
and mountain snow, but rainfall will begin to extend further east
into the southern Great Basin and Lower Colorado Valley. The
upper-low will begin to weak by early Thursday but scattered
showers and cool temperatures will persist in the Desert Southwest.

Farther east, showers and thunderstorms will be common as a pair
of frontal systems traverse the eastern half of the Lower 48.
Today is highlighted by a threat for severe weather in the Ohio
Valley and Mid-Atlantic. These same regions will also be at risk
for localized flash flooding within areas impacted by heavy
thunderstorms. The severe threat will move south on Wednesday
where the severe threat is forecast to take shape in the Southern
Plains, Mid-South, and Mid-Atlantic. As a strong cold front sweeps
through the eastern U.S. on Thursday, so will areas of
thunderstorms that could become severe from the Gulf Coast to the
Mid-Atlantic coast. Elsewhere, there is an Elevated to Critical
fire weather threat over the Southern/Central High Plains through
Tuesday, where downslope winds and low humidities will combine.

A very warm temperature regime will look to last a couple more
days from the front range of the Rockies to the East Coast. High
temperatures will reach the 80s in parts of the Heartland and the
South today. By Wednesday, portions of the Mid-Atlantic could make
a run at 80 degrees. This abnormally warm stretch of weather will
soon come to an end as a strong cold front travels across the
eastern U.S. the second half of the week. It will be the
equivalent of temperature whiplash in the Midwest as high
temperatures drop from the upper 70s on Wednesday to the 50s on
Thursday. The cold front is forecast to reach the East Coast by
Thursday ushering cooler and breezy conditions by week's end."

An anomalously deep upper-level low will be slow to move through
the Desert Southwest over the next few days.  A cold front ahead
of the deep upper low will be nearly stationary across southern
California through Wednesday morning.  Pacific moisture streaming
into southern California will bring the threat of excessive
rainfall into the region, which could lead to flash flooding in
the interior desert.  For the higher elevations, more than of foot
of snow can be expected especially along the southern Sierra
Nevada. By later on Wednesday, the precipitation should edge
farther east into Arizona and Utah. By Thursday, the upper-low is
forecast to weaken as the precipitation begins to become more
widely scattered and taper off across the entire Southwest.

Farther east, showers and thunderstorms will be common as a pair
of frontal systems traverse the eastern half of the country. The
threat for severe weather and heavy rain in the Ohio Valley into
the Mid-Atlantic should gradually ease this evening. However,
another frontal wave will once again raise the severe weather
threat farther south into the Tennessee Valley on Wednesday before
a strong cold front arrives from the west Wednesday night.  This
strong front is forecast to sweep through the eastern U.S. on
Thursday with strong thunderstorms possible across the
Mid-Atlantic states in the morning hours.

As the strong cold front moves rapidly off the East Coast on
Thursday, a low pressure system is forecast to intensify rapidly
near the New England coast.  This will lead to strengthening winds
across New England with accumulating snow likely to develop across
the interior sections. In addition, some lake-effect snow will
likely develop on Thursday downwind from the lower Great Lakes on
the back side of the low pressure system.  Meanwhile, a large cold
air mass ushering across much of the eastern two-thirds of the
country behind the strong cold front will bring much colder

The anomalously deep upper-level low that has doused California
with rain and mountain snowfall the last few days will continue to
slowly progress through the Desert Southwest through week's end. A
cold front ahead of the deep upper low will inch its way towards
the Lower Colorado River Valley this morning. Pacific moisture
streaming into southern California will bring the threat of
excessive rainfall into the region, which could lead to flash
flooding over the interior desert. In the higher elevations, more
than of foot of snow is expected most notably along the southern
Sierra Nevada. By Wednesday evening precipitation should edge
farther east into Arizona and southwestern Utah. The upper-low is
forecast to weaken by Thursday causing precipitation to become
more widely scattered and taper off across the Southwest, although
a few spotty showers cannot be ruled out.

Farther east, showers and thunderstorms will be common as a pair
of frontal systems traverse the eastern half of the country. As
the episode of severe weather in the eastern Ohio Valley finishes
early this morning, another frontal wave will once again raise the
severe weather threat farther south into the western Ohio Valley,
central Mississippi Valley, and Tennessee Valley on today before a
strong cold front arrives from the west Wednesday night. The Storm
Prediction Center has both an Enhanced and Slight Risks for severe
weather in these regions for later today. The strong front is
forecast to sweep through the eastern U.S. on Thursday with strong
thunderstorms possible across the Mid-Atlantic states in the
morning hours. Meanwhile, a chance for showers and thunderstorms
will be present in the western Gulf Coast region Thursday evening.

As the strong cold front moves rapidly off the East Coast on
Thursday, a low pressure system is forecast to rapidly intensify
near the New England coast. In response to this rapid deepening,
winds will pick up across New England with accumulating snow
likely to develop across the northern tier of the region. Winter
storm Watches have been issued for northern Maine as snowfall
accumulations over a foot are possible. When gusty winds are
paired with heavy snowfall, the potential exists for treacherous
travel and whiteout conditions. In addition, some lake-effect snow
will likely develop on Thursday downwind from the lower Great
Lakes on the back side of the low pressure system. Meanwhile, a
cold Canadian air mass will race across much of the eastern
two-thirds of the country in wake of the strong cold front.

The anomalously deep upper-level low that has doused California
with rain and mountain snowfall the last few days will continue to
wobble across the Desert Southwest for a couple more days. Pacific
moisture wrapping around the upper low will continue to bring the
threat of excessive rainfall into southern California through much
of Thursday, with the interior desert being more susceptible to
see flash flooding. In the higher elevations, more than of foot of
snow remains likely near the highest mountain peaks of southern
California, and possibly along the southern stretch of the Sierra
Nevada. By Thursday evening, the upper low should begin to show
signs of weakening as it drifts farther south to near the Mexican
border. Precipitation across southern California should gradually
become more widely scattered on Friday as the upper low begins to
move toward the east.

Farther east, a developing low pressure system ahead of a surge of
cold air from Canada will raise the severe weather threat from the
Ohio Valley down across the central Mississippi Valley and into
the Tennessee Valley through tonight. The severe weather threat
will quickly come to an end in these areas on Thursday as a cold
air mass rushes in behind a strong cold front. Some thunderstorms
can be expected to move across the Mid-Atlantic states Thursday
morning before much colder and blustery conditions arrive as a
coastal low pressure system is forecast to intensify rapidly near
the New England coast Thursday night.

In response to this rapid deepening storm, winds will pick up

The weather in the Northeast today and Friday will be highlighted
by a rapidly intensifying area of low pressure across New England
late Thursday into early Friday. On the northern side of the storm
precipitation will fall in the form of snow across northern New
England and pick up in intensity Thursday evening. Winds will also
become increasingly strong leading to near whiteout conditions and
drifting snow. By the time the snow tapers off later in the day on

localized spots of northern Maine and New Hampshire picking up as
much as two feet. In addition, lake effect snow showers will drop
several inches of snow down wind of Lakes Erie and Ontario with an
inch or two also possible in the central Appalachians.

To the south, the storm system's associated cold front will sweep
across the eastern U.S. with scattered showers and thunderstorms
developing along and ahead of the front this afternoon. Areas most
at risk are the megalopolis of the Northeast, the eastern
Carolinas, and southeast Texas. Some thunderstorms could be severe
and produce heavy downpours. The cold front will race into the
Atlantic Thursday evening ushering in a much cooler and drier

The upper-level low over southern California will slowly move
eastward and spread some showers over the Southwest as
temperatures stay below normal (only in the 60s/70s) thanks to
abundant cloudiness. Milder temperatures to the north will be
replaced by much colder air starting in Montana late today into
Saturday. A strong cold front will bring in modest to significant
snow to many areas of western Montana into Wyoming and the western
Dakotas as the front sinks southward.

spreads scattered precipitation eastward across Arizona on
Saturday, our attention will be drawn farther north over the
northern Rockies where a surge of cold Canadian air will arrive
behind a cold front.  Rain developing Friday night over Montana is
forecast to expand in coverage and change over to snow overnight. 
By Saturday evening, much of the northern Rockies into the
northern High Plains will be enveloped in snow as temperatures
plunge into the teens Saturday night.

Meanwhile, moisture from the Gulf of Mexico will return across the
southern Plains as the upper low approaches from the Desert
Southwest. A low pressure system will gradually deepen over the
central Plains under this pattern.  Rain will develop and then
expand across eastern Texas toward the lower Mississippi Valley on
Saturday along with an increasing threat of strong to severe
thunderstorms. Farther north rain will also expand across the
central Plains into the Midwest on Saturday as the cold front
approaches from the north.

The cold air mass from the north will begin to interact with the
upper low in the South as well as moisture streaming up from the
Gulf of Mexico to result in a rapidly intensifying low pressure
system over the central Plains on Sunday.  Widespread snow is
expected to fall across Wyoming into much of Colorado and should
begin to spread across the central Plains Sunday morning. 
Northerly winds are also expected to strengthen in these areas as
the storm intensifies.  Meanwhile, rain is expected to continue
expanding across the Mississippi Valley into the Ohio Valley as
the severe weather threat across much of the Deep South continues

high threat of heavy rain along with severe weather. Meanwhile,
snow and increasing winds could be spreading into the upper
Midwest when the already impressive low pressure system continues

To the south, moisture from the Gulf of Mexico will return across
the southern Plains as the lingering upper low approaches from the
Desert Southwest. A surface low pressure system will gradually
deepen over the central/southern Plains and move eastward toward
northern Arkansas by Sunday evening. Rain will develop and then
expand across eastern Texas toward the lower Mississippi Valley
today along with an increasing threat of strong to severe
thunderstorms. Farther north, rain will also expand across the
central Plains into the Midwest today as the cold front moves in

weather threat across much of the Mid and Deep South continues to
increase. By Sunday evening, areas in the Tennessee Valley may see
locally heavy rain that could lead to flash flooding and ponding
on roadways. To the north, snow and increasing winds will spread

Across the South, the environment is shaping up to for a very
potent storm system that will produce a myriad of hazardous
weather types. Moisture from the Gulf of Mexico will return across
the southern Plains as the lingering upper low approaches from the
Desert Southwest. A surface low will quickly spin up a low
pressure across the Southern Plains and it will deepen as it
tracks toward the Mississippi Valley. A widespread strong to
severe thunderstorm outbreak can be expected for a vast portion of
the South this weekend coupled with an elevated threat for heavy
rainfall and flooding concerns. The Storm Prediction Center has a
very broad Slight Risk area spanning from eastern TX/OK/KS to
central VA/NC. Within that region, the greatest threat for
widespread severe storms will span from central Louisiana to
north-central Alabama where SPC has identified a Moderate Risk.
WPC has highlighted threat areas of heavy rainfall and widespread
flooding issues for much of the same region as SPC's severe
threat. A Moderate Risk is in effect for  northern Mississippi to
western NC/VA. It will be very important to remain weather aware
the next couple of days.

Once the blast of cold air reaches this system in the
south/central U.S. it will go through rapid intensification and
quickly track north and east spreading precipitation through the
Ohio Valley, Great Lakes, Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast. A surge
of mild air will result in well above normal temperatures (but
with rain/storms) for much of the I-95 corridor especially Monday.
Across Florida, temperatures in the 80s/low 90s may again approach

...Flash flooding and severe weather threat for parts of Texas
eastward to the Tennessee Valley and Southeast today...

...Significant cold and snowfall across the Corn Belt into the
western Great Lakes...

...Rain and storms for much of the East Coast Monday...

A potent storm system continues to organize over the
central/southern Plains today as a cold airmass to the north
collides with warm and humid air out of the Gulf of Mexico. This
may set up a very active severe weather and flash flooding event
first over Texas during the day then progressing eastward through
the Lower Mississippi Valley into the Tennessee Valley and
Southeast. The Storm Prediction Center has noted a Moderate Risk
of severe weather from Louisiana to Alabama and a larger Slight
Risk area over multiple states in the warm sector and just to the
north of an advancing warm front. The Weather Prediction Center
has issued a Moderate Risk of Excessive Rainfall near and to the
northeast of the highest severe weather threat.

To the north, Winter Storm Warnings and Winter Weather Advisories
remain in effect from the Plains eastward and northeastward across
the Corn Belt to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan where several
inches of snow is expected in the colder air. A foot of snow could
fall over the U.P. of Michigan as the area of low pressure rapidly
deepens and moves toward the central Great Lakes by early Monday.
Wind will increase as well to the northwest of the low (resulting
in blowing snow and cold wind chills) but also to the east of the
cold front on strong southerly flow. Well above normal
temperatures are expected for for much of the I-95 corridor on
Monday before cooler air rushes in. Record highs are forecast for
parts of the Gulf Coast today and over much of Florida today and
Monday. Behind the front, record cold is likely from Montana
across the Plains with readings more typical of mid-winter."

...Severe weather and flash flooding expected to be widespread
across the Southeast and Tennessee Valley through tonight...

...Severe weather a threat for the Eastern Seaboard Monday...

...Significant cold and snowfall forecast for the Upper Midwest to
Upper Great Lakes through Monday...

A potent storm system will continue moving northeastward through
Monday, causing a variety of weather hazards. On the southern
side, widespread thunderstorms are likely, and the atmospheric
conditions are expected to be favorable for severe weather for the
Lower Mississippi Valley, Tennessee Valley, and Southeast through
tonight. Tornadoes, hail, and high winds are all potential severe
threats. As rain amounts could exceed 2 inches in some locations,
and there is the potential for training (storms repeating over the
same location), flash flooding is another hazard today and tonight
just north of the highest severe weather threat, in the Tennessee
Valley toward the Southern Appalachians. Moderate Risks of both
severe weather and flash flooding are in place through tonight. As
the cold fronts sweep eastward toward the Eastern Seaboard, severe
weather is once again a threat on Monday especially ahead of the
initial cold front--an Enhanced Risk of severe weather has been
outlooked for portions of the Southeast to Mid-Atlantic. There
could be isolated incidents of flash flooding in the Mid-Atlantic
to Northeast, but rain and storms should be fast-moving, so the
flooding threat should not be as widespread on Monday.

To the north and west of the track of the surface lows, cold
temperatures will support snow continuing across portions of the
Upper Midwest to Great Lakes region through Monday, and Winter
Storm Warnings and Winter Weather Advisories are in effect. Snow
amounts should peak over the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, where
over a foot of snow is forecast. Winds are expected to increase as
well, not only to the west of the low (resulting in blowing snow
and cold wind chills), but also to the east of the cold front with
strong southerly flow. Widespread Wind Advisories and High Wind
Watches/Warnings are in place across the eastern half of the U.S.

The strong cold fronts associated with this storm system will
cause large temperature drops across the Mississippi, Ohio, and
Tennessee Valleys on Monday. Record cold temperatures are possible
from the Northern Rockies to portions of the Plains and
Mississippi Valley as a cold high pressure system settles in
behind the front. Freeze Warnings are in place for parts of the
Southern/Central Plains to the Middle Mississippi Valley. A very
warm Monday across the East, which could set widespread record
high minimum temperatures, will give way to much cooler
temperatures on Tuesday in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast.
Meanwhile, Florida remains south of the cold front and could have
record-breaking heat again for the beginning of the workweek.

Elsewhere, the Southwest could see showers in lower elevations
with snow mixing in at higher elevations. Snow is expected to be
persistent over the Central Rockies, with over 6 inches possible.
Lighter snow could spread into the Southern and Central High
Plains Monday into early Tuesday, meaning the Oklahoma and Texas
Panhandles could see unusually late in the ""season"" snow. Light
snow is also possible across the north-central tier."

...Widespread flash flooding and severe weather are expected on

The synoptic pattern across the U.S. will continue to support an
active storm track across the southern tier states.  Moisture
currently returning from the Gulf of Mexico will interact with a
frontal boundary along the Gulf Coast as an upper-level trough
moves into the southern Plains.  This will result in a low
pressure wave to develop and intensify along the frontal boundary
as the wave tracks rapidly across the Deep South toward the

very active day in terms of heavy rain and severe weather from
central Mississippi eastward into South Carolina where over 3
inches of rain could fall over areas that have received above
normal rainfall over the past few weeks.  This will exacerbate the
flooding and flash flooding threats in these areas.  The low
pressure wave is forecast to further intensify and move rapidly
off the East Coast during the day on Monday, pushing the rain out
into the Atlantic by the afternoon.

Elsewhere, a cold front will bring main light precipitation across
the northern Plains into the Great Lakes into tonight, followed by
the Northeast and the Mid-Atlantic on Sunday, and then into the
Atlantic on Monday.  A frontal system ahead of a low pressure

...Widespread severe weather and flash flooding are expected today
and tonight from the Lower Mississippi Valley to the Southeast...

The synoptic pattern across the U.S. will continue to support an
active storm track across the southern tier states.  Moisture and
instability currently returning north from the Gulf of Mexico will
interact with a front draped across the Gulf Coast states as an
upper-level trough crosses the southern Plains and moves toward
the lower Mississippi Valley. This will result in multiple waves
of low pressure developing along the front which are expected to
move rapidly eastward across the Deep South today and then
consolidate toward the Mid-Atlantic coast early Monday.

Today is expected to be a very active day in terms of severe
weather, with a focus on a broad area from eastern Texas eastward
into South Carolina, and which also just one week ago saw a major
severe weather outbreak with numerous tornadoes. This next round
of severe weather for today and tonight is expected to bring
another threat of large hail, damaging winds and tornadoes to many
of the same areas. The Storm Prediction Center has highlighted
portions of the Deep South in a Moderate Risk of severe weather
going through Monday morning, with particular concern for areas of
northern Louisiana, central Mississippi and central Alabama.

In addition to the severe weather, heavy rainfall is expected and
locally several inches of new rainfall may fall over areas that
have received above normal rainfall over the past few weeks. Given
the wet antecedent conditions, this additional rainfall will
foster renewed flooding and flash flooding concerns across these
areas. In fact, the Weather Prediction Center has issued a
Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall from central Mississippi
eastward to South Carolina, and thus there is a sizable overlap
with the aforementioned severe weather hazards. The intensifying
and consolidating waves of low pressure are forecast to exit the
Mid-Atlantic coast on Monday and move rapidly out to sea which
will allow the severe weather and excessive rainfall threats to
come to an end.

Elsewhere, a cold front will bring main light precipitation across
portions of the Northeast today, with cooler and drier weather
following on Monday as this front then moves offshore. There will
be yet another cold front that will drop southeast from Canada and
bring another round of light precipitation across the Great Lakes
on Monday.

Meanwhile, a mix of rain and snow is forecast to track across the
interior Northwest and through the northern and central Rockies
today and tonight. A couple inches of new snowfall are expected
for the higher elevations. Additionally, portions of the Southwest
are expected to see a couple rounds of showers and maybe a few
thunderstorms by Monday as an upper trough begins to move inland
off the Pacific Ocean.

Temperature-wise, generally cooler than normal temperatures can be
expected across a good portion of the northern Plains, Midwest and
the eastern U.S. going into early next week as reinforcing cold
fronts continue to drop southeast Canada. Cooler than normal
temperatures will also tend to focus over the Southwest as there
will be an increase in clouds and shower activity. By contrast,
the warmest weather with above normal temperatures are expected

...Widespread severe weather and flash flooding are expected
through tonight from the Lower Mississippi Valley to the
Southeast...

The synoptic pattern across the U.S. will continue to support an
active storm track across the southern tier states.  Multiple
clusters of strong to severe thunderstorms continuing heavy rain
continue to develop across the interior sections of the Deep South
this Sunday afternoon.  These thunderstorms and heavy rains are in
response to moisture and instability lifted along a stationary
front as a low pressure system develops and rapidly approaches
from Texas.  Multiple low pressure waves will continue to develop
along the stationary front, leading to more heavy thunderstorms to
impact the interior Southeast through tonight.  The Storm
Prediction Center continues to highlight areas from north-central
Louisiana eastward to southern and central Mississippi, southern
and central Alabama, and south-central Georgia as having the
greatest threat of severe weather through tonight. In addition to
the severe weather, the associated heavy rain will likely result
in flash flooding in parts of the areas.

The low pressure waves are expected to move rapidly eastward and
consolidate  into a low pressure system, which is forecast to exit
the East Coast on Monday.  Some strong thunderstorms are still
possible from Georgia to the Carolinas Monday morning before the
storms rapidly move out to sea during the afternoon.

Elsewhere, a cold front will bring mainly light precipitation
across portions of the Northeast through tonight, followed by a
return of cooler and drier conditions on Monday behind the front.
There will be yet another cold front that will drop southeast from
Canada and bring another round of light wintry mixed precipitation
across the Great Lakes on Monday.  By Tuesday, the mixed
precipitation is expected to move into the Northeast, with rain
and some thunderstorms possibly extending as far south as the
central Appalachians.

Meanwhile, a mix of rain and snow is forecast to track across
parts of the western U.S. from California through the central
Rockies for the next couple of days, where accumulating snowfall
is expected for the higher elevations. This is in response to yet
another upper trough edging into the Southwest from the Pacific
Ocean, and will set the stage for another low pressure system to
develop over the southern High Plains on Tuesday. Showers and
thunderstorms are expected to expand eastward into the southern
Plains as snow continues to fall in the higher elevations of
Colorado."

...Severe weather expected to continue this morning over eastern
portions of the Southeast...

As waves of low pressure along the front stretching across the
Southeast begin to consolidate, they will move eastward into the
Atlantic later today. Before then, thunderstorms are forecast to
continue in the Southeast and southern portions of the
Mid-Atlantic. Today, a Slight to Enhanced Risk of severe weather
is forecast for coastal portions of Georgia and the Carolinas
before storms move out to sea.

A low pressure system sweeping through south-central and
southeastern Canada over the next couple of days will sweep a cold
front across the Midwest today and the Eastern Seaboard on
Tuesday. Precipitation is forecast in the vicinity of the front,
some in the form of snow. Another round of light accumulating snow
is possible for the Great Lakes region to the interior Northeast.
Farther south and east, thunderstorms are possible in portions of
the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast on Tuesday, some of which could be
strong to severe. This cold front and lower than normal
upper-level heights should also lead to cooler than average
temperatures; the Great Lakes can expect high temperatures of 15
to 25 degrees below normal on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, a mix of light rain and snow is expected across parts
of California, the Central Great Basin, and the Four Corners
through Tuesday, as upper-level energy moves across and then into
the Southern/Central High Plains. By Tuesday, thunderstorms are
forecast to increase in coverage across the Plains--a Slight Risk
of severe weather is in place for parts of the Southern Plains on
Tuesday, with locally heavy rain causing a few instances of flash
flooding possible there as well. Severe thunderstorms and heavy
rain are expected for the Lower Mississippi Valley on Wednesday.

While portions of the northern and eastern portions of the country
will be colder than average, the Florida peninsula will once again
be a hot spot, with possible record high temperatures. Warmer than
average temperatures are also possible in southern portions of
Texas and in the Northwest, spreading eastward to the Northern
Plains Tuesday."

...A developing low pressure system is forecast to bring heavy
rain and strong to severe thunderstorms from the southern Plains
to west of the lower Mississippi Valley on Wednesday...

A strong cold front associated with a deepening low pressure
system moving across southern Canada will bring a quick round of
precipitation across the Great Lakes into the Northeast for the
next couple of days.  Showers and thunderstorms are expected
tonight from the Great Lakes to the central Appalachians ahead of
the cold front.  By Tuesday, the dynamics of the associated
upper-level trough will help trigger strong to severe
thunderstorms from the northern Mid-Atlantic to the southern New
England before colder and drier air ushers into the region later
in the afternoon and into the evening.  Behind the front, some
snow or mixed precipitation is forecast to linger in the vicinity
of the Great Lakes as the cold air mass from Canada overspreads
the Northeast and down into much of the East Coast through
Wednesday.

Meanwhile, a mix of light rain and snow is expected to slide
across parts of California, the central Great Basin, and the Four
Corners areas through Tuesday, as a broad upper-level trough moves
across.  This will set the stage for another low pressure system
to form and deepen over the southern Plains.  Showers and
thunderstorms are forecast to increase in coverage across the
central to southern Plains on Tuesday ahead of the system.  By
Wednesday, an increasing risk of severe weather can be expected
from the southern Plains eastward toward the lower Mississippi
Valley by the evening.  Heavy rain could also lead to flash
flooding in these areas especially by Wednesday evening.

Elsewhere, a clipper low pressure wave is forecast to spread mixed
precipitation across the upper Midwest into the Great Lakes on
Wednesday.  While portions of the northern and eastern portions of
the country will be colder than average, the Florida peninsula
will remain very warm behind a cold front. Warmer than average
temperatures are also expected for much of the West, spreading
eastward into much the Plains Tuesday and Wednesday."

As a cold front moves across the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic today,
thunderstorms are forecast along and ahead of it. A Slight Risk of
severe weather is forecast by the Storm Prediction Center for
northern parts of the Mid-Atlantic and southern parts of the
Northeast before storms move out to sea by this afternoon and
evening. Behind the front, light rain and snow is expected for the
Great Lakes to the interior Northeast, and a few inches of snow
could accumulate in some locations like northern Maine. Windy
conditions are also expected, and Wind Advisories are in place for
southern New York and southern New England.

This cold front will also usher in cold air for the Great Lakes
region and Northeast, with high temperatures 15 to 25 degrees
below normal. Meanwhile, the Northern Plains should be a warm spot
over the next couple of days, along with southern Texas and the
Florida peninsula again.

An upper-level trough will first lead to rain and snow showers
across the Four Corners, and then spread thunderstorms into the
Southern Plains today as it moves eastward and a surface low
pressure system consolidates. Severe weather is forecast with this
thunderstorm activity, so a Slight Risk of severe weather in in
place for much of Oklahoma and parts of the Texas Panhandle today.
Localized heavy rainfall of 1 to 2 inches causing a few instances
of flash flooding is also possible. As the system moves east on
Wednesday, thunderstorms are expected to increase across the Lower
Mississippi Valley while remaining across eastern parts of the
Southern Plains, and severe weather and flash flooding are once
again forecast. The highest risk for flash flooding will be across
areas that have seen lots of rainfall over the past couple of
weeks. Behind this system, Critical fire weather conditions are

this next system will likely move over areas that recently
received heavy rains and flooding.  Stream flows are much above
average across these areas, with the expected additional rains
likely to produce additional flooding across portions of
Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama.

On the west and southwest side of the developing Southern Plains
storm, winds will be increasing across the Southern High Plains

A storm system moving through the Tennessee Valley and Southeast
will continue an ongoing threat for severe thunderstorms capable
of producing tornadoes, large hail and severe straight-line winds
mainly near and south of a warm front which extends through
Georgia into the western Atlantic. Deep moisture from the Gulf of

Southeast into Florida. Thunderstorms with this system will likely
push offshore of the East Coast by early Friday morning but will
linger across central to northern Florida into Friday afternoon.
Up north, a cold rain can be expected for the northern
Mid-Atlantic region into the Northeast before the cold front moves
offshore for Friday night.

Meanwhile, another storm system will be moving across the U.S.,
tracking from the Intermountain West into the Midwest early Friday
morning into Saturday evening. While the deepest moisture will
remain south of the front pushing offshore of the East Coast into
Florida, sufficient dynamics aloft and a modest moisture return to
the north will favor another round of potentially severe

...Heavy snow for parts of the mountains of New York and New
England, a cool valley and coastal rain across the rest of the
Northeast and Mid-Atlantic...

...Record heat possible in parts of the Southwest...

...A new storm system to generate unsettled weather across the
central U.S. Tuesday, reaching eastern regions by Wednesday...

A large storm system will continue to cause damp, dreary, and
gusty conditions across much of the Northeast and eastern Ohio
Valley this evening. The storm will be in no rush to leave as it
meanders off the Northeast coast on Monday and keeping spotty
showers around for one more day across the region. Cold high
pressure to the north is also working to spill cooler temperatures
into New England and into the Mid-Atlantic. Daily record cool max
temps could be set in parts of the Northeast on Monday. Snow is
also on tap in the northern New England where Winter Weather
Advisories are in effect through Monday morning. Some locations
could pick up as much as six inches or more of snow by the time
the storm finally departs by early Tuesday.

Meanwhile, sizzling temperatures continue in the Desert Southwest
and show no signs of backing down through the first half of the
week. Forecast highs in the Desert Southwest each day this weekend
should at the very least be in the 80s while some spots surpass
the century mark and/or challenge daily record high temps.
Excessive Heat Warnings remain in effect for the Phoenix metro
area and portions of the far Lower Colorado River Valley through
Monday. Northern and central New Mexico remain at risk for
elevated fire weather conditions this afternoon and into Monday.
While parts of the Plains cool down some on Tuesday, the dome of
hot high pressure in the Southwest should amplify over California
and the Great Basin, resulting in abnormally hot temperatures to
stick around in these areas into the middle of the week.

As one storm system finally heads out to sea off the East Coast, a
new area of low pressure sending precipitation into the Pacific
Northwest tonight and Monday will enter the Northern Plains on
Tuesday. The storm is forecast to intensify late Tuesday because
of a strengthening upper level trough diving south through the
Midwest. The storm system's cold front will sweep across the
Plains Tuesday and into the Mississippi Valley Tuesday night with
the potential for severe weather to develop. The Storm Prediction
Center issued a Slight Risk for severe weather and the Weather
Prediction Center has a Marginal Risk for excessive rainfall in
portions of the Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley
Tuesday. The threat for showers and thunderstorms are forecast to
reach the East Coast states by Wednesday."

damaging wind over the region on Tuesday.  The thunderstorms will
produce damaging squall lines with perhaps hurricane force wind
and wind-driven hail. In addition, there is a slight risk of

...Very warm weather to continue across much of the West...

A developing storm system over the Plains and Midwest will produce
widespread showers and thunderstorms, including a likelihood of
severe weather, for parts of the Midwest and extending south to
include the southern Plains and the lower Mississippi Valley going
through the evening and overnight hours. In fact, the Storm
Prediction Center has highlighted a Moderate Risk of severe
weather for much of eastern Oklahoma, north-central and northeast
Texas, and far western Arkansas where the greatest risk of large
hail, damaging winds and a few tornadoes will be going through
tonight. In addition to the severe weather hazards, there will be
heavy rainfall and some concerns for flash flooding for many of
the same areas. In fact, the Weather Prediction Center has
highlighted a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall for areas of
eastern Oklahoma, eastern Texas, southern Arkansas, northern
Louisiana and west-central Mississippi going through early
Wednesday morning. As much as 2 to 3 inches of rain, with isolated
heavier amounts, can be expected for these areas.

The aforementioned storm system will be moving into the eastern
U.S. by Wednesday night and Thursday as low pressure advances into
the Great Lakes region. This will drive a cold front eastward from
the Midwest to the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys, and across the Gulf
Coast. The threat of severe weather, especially from damaging
winds, is expected to shift out of the lower Mississippi Valley
Wednesday morning and move east across the Gulf Coast states going
through Wednesday evening. On Thursday, interior sections of the
Southeast and portions of the Mid-Atlantic region may have some
localized concerns for severe weather too. Heavy rainfall is
expected across many of these areas, and especially areas of the
central and southern Appalachians, and the Mid-Atlantic states on
Thursday as a new area of low pressure forms in the lee of the
Appalachians and helps to enhance the fetch of warm, moist air
northward up along the Eastern Seaboard. As much as 2 to 3 inches
of rain will also be expected for these areas with isolated
heavier amounts. Some runoff problems and areas of flooding will
be possible given the totals and relatively wet antecedent
conditions.

Meanwhile, much above normal temperatures will continue over the
Desert Southwest and Great Basin as a strong ridge of high
pressure continues to dominate the weather here at least through
midweek. Temperatures will be as much as 10 to 20 degrees above
normal, and that will allow some of the interior deserts of the
Southwest to again exceed 100 degrees. By Thursday, some of this
very warm air will begin to shift eastward and should begin to
advance out across the High Plains as the ridge shifts eastward in
response to an upper trough approaching the West Coast. By
contrast, much of the East will tend to have cooler than normal
temperatures given the large expanse of clouds and rainfall
expected over the next couple of days. In some cases, especially
over the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys, and parts of the Northeast,
the temperatures will be as much as 10 to 20 degrees below normal."

advances east the remainder of the weekend. Showers and
thunderstorms will breakout along the cold front this evening over
the Lower Great Lakes and into the Central Plains. Some
thunderstorms could be severe with the potential for excessive
rainfall as well. The cold front will then push east into the Ohio
Valley and Mid-Atlantic on Sunday where both regions are at risk
of severe thunderstorms and excessive rainfall. The area most at
risk for flash flooding Sunday lies in the eastern Ohio Valley and
central Appalachians. By Monday, the cold front will have reached
the Atlantic and in its wake turn temperatures to the cool-side
from the Midwest to the Northeast. Much of the northeastern
quarter of the U.S. will dry out Monday but a few spotty showers
are possible across New England.

Further west, a frontal boundary stationed over the Central
Rockies will ignite showers and thunderstorms across the region
this evening, some of which could be severe. Meanwhile, a Pacific
frontal system will march its way through the Pacific Northwest
tonight with numerous showers and some very high elevation
snowfall in the forecast. This system will sail across the
northern Rockies and a new wave of low pressure is likely to
develop in the northern High Plains on Sunday. This newly
developed area of low pressure should generate thunderstorms in
its warm sector Sunday afternoon and evening. To the south,
favorable fire weather conditions will continue in the southern
Rockies and High Plains this afternoon where Red Flag Warnings are

tomorrow for parts of the Southwest.

By Monday, May 4th, the force will be strong with an area of low
pressure over the Southern Plains as it generates showers and
thunderstorms across the Nation's Heartland. There is the
potential for severe weather and heavy rainfall just ahead of the
storm in the Central Plains and Middle Mississippi Valley. In
addition, warm and humid conditions are likely south of a warm

develop in the northern High Plains this evening where
thunderstorms can be expected.  A swath of rain ahead of this wave
will continue to move across the northern Plains on Monday,
reaching the upper Midwest Tuesday morning where mixed wintry
precipitation is possible.

By Monday, strong dynamics associated with a developing low
pressure system over the southern Plains will trigger strong to
possibly severe thunderstorms to move across the Nation's
Heartland, with the highest potential over the Mid-Mississippi and
Ohio Valley Monday evening.  Heavy rainfall will also be possible
in these areas.  By Tuesday morning, the highest chance of rain

...A pair of storm systems to make for a wet and stormy Monday in
the Plains and Mississippi Valley Monday, additional storms
possible across the South on Tuesday...

...Amplifying jet stream pattern to make for increasingly hot
conditions in the Southwest and much cooler temperatures in the
East...

This evening, a frontal boundary stretching from the Northeast to
the Southern Plains will spark additional showers and
thunderstorms. Some storms could be severe and produce heavy
rainfall. Slight risks for severe weather and excessive rainfall
have been issued for the Ohio Valley but the threat for severe
storms extends as far west as the middle Mississippi Valley.
Showers and thunderstorms will dot the Rockies and northern High
Plains where some storms could also become severe.

The bulk of the precipitation across the Lower 48 the first half
of the week will come at the hands of two storm systems in the
Plains. One area of low pressure will generate scattered showers
and thunderstorms across the Midwest on Monday. To the south, a
more potent area of low pressure will be the catalyst for yet
another round of severe weather from West Texas and the Mid-South
to the southern Appalachians on Monday. The northern most feature
will fizzle out on Tuesday with remnant showers possible in the
Midwest and Ohio Valley, while the southern wave has the best
chance to produce a broad area of potential thunderstorms from the
Rio Grande River to the Carolina coast.

The weather pattern through the period can be summarized by the
start of an increasingly amplified jet stream pattern over North
America that will continue into next weekend. Starting out west,
an intensifying upper level ridge over the Southwest means the
return of sizzling temperatures to the region. Temperatures in the
Desert Southwest will surpass the century mark by Tuesday and
continue into Wednesday with the potential for record warmth. Much
of California and the Great Basin will also bask in increasingly
warmer temperatures through Tuesday. In the East, a deepening
trough in the jet stream pattern will usher in a Canadian air-mass
that will force temperatures to plummet from the Midwest to the
Northeast. The Southeast will see the summer-like temperatures
stick around through Tuesday but cooler temperatures should arrive
mid-week."

days...

...More record heat returns to the Desert Southwest as much cooler
temperatures overspread the East...

The weather pattern across the U.S. will continue to promote an
active storm track across the mid-section of the country toward
the East Coast.  A low pressure system over New England will be
slow to depart the area.  Rain is expected to linger across
northern New England through today.  Colder air behind the low
will settle into much of the northern and northeastern U.S. into
mid-week.  The cold air is expected to change the rain over to wet
snow or mixed precipitation across northern New England tonight
before tapering off Tuesday morning. 

Meanwhile, a Pacific front pushing into the High Plains is
interacting with a stationary front, producing clusters of showers
and thunderstorms in the vicinity.  Some of these storms could be
strong to severe and could contain heavy rainfall.  A swath of
showers and thunderstorms is expected to spread eastward across
the northern and central Plains today as another low pressure wave
is forecast to intensify over the central Plains.  It appears that
the Mid-Mississippi Valley will see the highest chance of strong
to severe thunderstorms later today, pushing quickly eastward into
the southern Appalachians by Tuesday morning ahead of the low
pressure wave.  Rain will then overspread the Mid-Atlantic region
on Tuesday as the low pressure wave passes to the south.  In the
mean time, scattered thunderstorms can be expected to stretch
along a trailing cold front across the Southeast into the Deep
South.  By Wednesday morning, the low pressure system will begin
to move off the East Coast but rain will linger over many
locations along the East Coast into the Ohio Valley due to a
trough of low pressure.

The swath of rain across the northern Plains is forecast to push
eastward into the upper Midwest Tuesday night.  Some of the rain
could change over to wintry precipitation Tuesday morning as it
approaches the upper Great Lakes.

Meanwhile, more record high temperatures are expected to return
across the Desert Southwest as the upper level ridge is forecast
to build, which will be in stark contrast with the much below
normal temperatures over the Northeast. The Southeast will see the
summer-like temperatures sticking around through Tuesday but
cooler temperatures should arrive mid-week."

Mid-Atlantic Tuesday and Wednesday.  Heavy rains and isolated
flash flooding possible from the Mid Mississippi Valley and Ohio
Valley tonight into Tuesday.  Severe thunderstorms possible Monday

The trailing cold front from this area of low pressure will bring
much cooler temperatures to the Southern Plains which has had
several days of record high temperatures.  High temperatures are
expected to be slightly below average over the Southern Plains on
Tuesday and near average on Wednesday.

The core of the above average temperatures over the next two days
will be from Southern California into the Southwest and Great
Basin.  High temperatures across these regions expected to be 10
to 15 degrees above average.  In contrast, much below average
temperatures will persist across the northeastern quarter of the
nation from the Upper Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, Ohio Valley
and Mid Atlantic.  Across these areas high temperatures are
expected to be 10-15 degrees below average.  Portions of the Upper
Ohio Valley, Central Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic may see record
low maximum temperatures both Tuesday and Wednesday."

A developing low pressure system over the Mid-Mississippi Valley
will move relatively quickly toward the Mid-Atlantic coast by
Wednesday morning as it slowly intensifies.  This will keep a good
chance of rain for the central Appalachians into the Mid-Atlantic
states through much of Wednesday.  Areas in western Pennsylvania
could even see some wet snow Wednesday morning as colder air
settles into much of the Northeast on the back side of the storm. 
The storm should continue to intensify off the New England coast
Thursday morning with rain most likely moving across southeastern
New England. Thunderstorms will be likely across the Deep South,
the Southeast, and into the Carolinas through Tuesday night ahead
of a cold front.  Clearing skies and much cooler temperatures will
follow on Wednesday, spreading further south into Florida by
Thursday behind the cold front.

Over the Pacific Northwest, a quick round of moderately heavy
precipitation will move across the region early Wednesday as a
cold front pushes quickly inland.  Some high-elevation wintry
precipitation will move into the northern Rockies late Wednesday
into early on Thursday as a new low pressure system begins to
develop over the High Plains.  Much cooler air will then settle
across much of the northwestern U.S. behind the Pacific cold
front.  On the other side of the front, chance of thunderstorms
will be on the increase early Thursday ahead of the developing
system over the central Plains. 

Meanwhile, above average temperatures will continue from southern
California into the Desert Southwest and the Great Basin.  High
temperatures across these regions are expected to be 10 to 15
degrees above average.  In contrast, much below average
temperatures will persist across the northeastern quarter of the
nation from the Upper Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, Ohio Valley

Low pressure over the Carolinas into the Mid-Atlantic a long with
a very moist air mass will aid in developing showers and
thunderstorms over parts of the Southern Appalachians eastward to
the Carolina Coast.  The SPC has issued a slight risk of severe
thunderstorms over this area. The primary hazards associated with
the severe weather will be damaging wind and hail.  Along with the
storms, associated heavy rain may produce localized isolated flash
flooding. the storm will move off the coast by Wednesday afternoon
and move northward just off the coast to keep the threat of light
rain over parts of the Mid-Atlantic into New England through
Thursday morning. 

Elsewhere, above average temperatures will continue from southern
California into the Desert Southwest and the Great Basin.  High

A low pressure system will keep a good chance of rain today from
the central Appalachians into the Mid-Atlantic.  As the low
deepens and slides off the East Coast, the rain will skirt
southeastern new England tonight into Thursday morning. 
Meanwhile, a swath of moderately heavy precipitation associated
with a Pacific cold front is moving across the Northwest.  The
precipitation will quickly move across the northern Rockies into
the northern High Plains tonight as a low pressure center begins
to form along the front. Some high-elevation wet snow is possible
early on Thursday.  As the system pushes into the Plains, the
stage will be set for yet another episode of widespread rain and
thunderstorms that will expand quickly across the central Plains
towards the East Coast on Thursday and into Friday.  It appears
that the central Plains will see the highest chance of heavy rain
on Thursday.  By Friday morning, showers and thunderstorms are
forecast to move across the Deep South and become a steady rain
over the Ohio Valley. Meanwhile, wintry mixed precipiation can be
expected across the Great Lakes and parts of the Northeast.

Elsewhere, above average temperatures will become more confined
across the Desert Southwest as the Pacific cold front brings down
cooler air from the north.  The heat will then spill into the
southern High Plains on Thursday.  High temperatures across these
regions are expected to be 10 to 15 degrees above average.  In

thunderstorms will develop over parts of the Plains on Thursday. 
Showers and thunderstorms will continue over parts of the Plains
and Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley on Thursday night into Friday.
 In addition, a weak front moving south over parts of the Upper
Midwest will merge with the storm coming out of Texas to produce a
front extending from parts of the Mid-Atlantic to the Southern

...A late-season snowstorm becomes increasingly likely for the
interior Northeast beginning Friday and culminating on Saturday...

...Near record heat continues across the Desert Southwest as a
surge of abnormally cold air pushes south into much of the eastern
U.S. on Saturday...

An unusual weather pattern evolving across North America will lead
to widespread rain and thunderstorms to move across the central
and eastern U.S. before a late-season snowstorm becomes
increasingly likely for the interior Northeast by the weekend. 
The low pressure system associated with this event is currently in
the developmental stage across the High Plains.  A Pacific front
that has moved through the western U.S. is forecast to interact
with a stationary front, leading to the formation of a low
pressure system over the central Plains later today.  A swath of
rain and high-elevation snow across the northern Rockies this
morning will quickly expand eastward into the central Plains ahead
of the developing system where severe thunderstorms will be
possible by tonight.  The vigorous dynamics associated with the
developing system will likely bring a period of enhanced rainfall
and thunderstorms eastward through the Mid-Mississippi and Ohio
Valleys on Friday while severe thunderstorms are possible across
the Deep South.  In the mean time, an unusually cold air mass for
this time of the year is forecast to plunge southward into the
Great Lakes toward the eastern U.S.  This will set the stage for a
late-season snow event for the interior Northeast beginning on
Friday as the low pressure system continues to intensify while
moving quickly across the Tennessee Valley into the central
Appalachians.  Rain can be expected to change over to wet snow,
possibly heavy, over the central Appalachians on Friday before
blustery winds and colder air pushing in on the back side of the
storm.  By Friday night, the low pressure system is forecast to
further intensify as the storm center skirts the New England
coast.  It appears that interior New England will see significant
amount of wet snow with northerly winds becoming increasingly
strong and gusty late Friday night into Saturday morning.

The unusually cold air mass from eastern Canada will be pulled
southward down into the eastern U.S. behind the storm, resulting
in widespread record low temperatures spanning as far south as
Alabama and Mississippi on Saturday.  This will be in stark
contrast with near record heat across southern California, the
Desert Southwest, and the southern Rockies.  In addition, fire
danger will be very high today over much of the southern Rockies
as the low pressure system develops over the central Plains. 
Lowering humidity and gusty winds will also help elevate the risk
of wildfires over parts of Florida.  Meanwhile, the Pacific
Northwest will catch a break in precipitation as a gradual warming
trend sets in."

...There is a slight risk of severe thunderstorms and excessive
rainfall over parts of the Southern Plains...

...Near record heat continues across the Desert Southwest into

A system over the Southern Plains will shift northeastward along
front moving across the Plains and Midwest.  To the south of the
associated low pressure area, fire danger will be very high over
much of the Southern Rockies and Southern High Plains into this
evening.  Well ahead of the front, lowering humidity and gusty
winds will also help elevate the risk of wildfires over parts of
Florida into this evening.  The wave of low pressure will move
over the Middle Mississippi Valley by Friday morning and then
northeastward to the Mid-Atlantic by Friday evening and into the
Gulf of Maine by Saturday morning.  The storm will produce showers
and thunderstorms over parts of the Southern Plains on Thursday
evening into Friday morning.  The SPC has slight risk of severe
thunderstorms over parts of the Southern Plains, likewise, through
Friday morning.  The main hazards with the severe storms will be
severe hail and damaging thunderstorm wind gust.  In a similar
fashion, the WPC has issued a slight risk of excessive rainfall
over parts of the Southern Plains.  The major threat from
excessive rainfall will be mainly localized scattered flash
flooding. 

In addition, the wave of low pressure will aid in pulling much
colder than average air over the Northeast.  On Friday afternoon,
light snow will start to develop over parts of the Great Lakes and
expand into the Ohio Valley by Friday evening.  Overnight Friday,
the snow will expand into parts of the Central Appalachians and
into parts of the Northeast.  By Saturday evening the snow will
move into parts of Northern New England.  It appears that interior
New England will see significant amount of wet snow with northerly
wind becoming increasingly strong and gusty late Friday night into
Saturday morning.  The unusually cold air mass from eastern Canada
will be pulled southward down into the eastern U.S. behind the
storm, resulting in widespread record low temperatures spanning as
far south as Alabama and Mississippi on Saturday.

In stark contrast to what's evolving across the East, near record
heat is expected across southern California, the Desert Southwest,
and the Southern Rockies.   Meanwhile, the Pacific Northwest will
catch a break in precipitation as a gradual warming trend sets in.
 Lastly, an Alberta clipper is forecast to spread rain and mixed
wintry precipitation into the northern Plains and parts of the
Northern Rockies Friday into Saturday morning."

Today, a storm system over the Southern Plains will drift east
sparking additional showers and thunderstorms along the storm's
associated cold front. There is the potential for some storms to
become severe in the Lower Mississippi Valley where a Slight Risk
has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. Storms could also
lead to locally heavy downpours and a chance for some flash
flooding. The cold front will sweep across the Southeast Friday
evening leading to a mostly dry and very cool weekend for most
southern residents. Some spotty showers and storms are possible in
South Texas early on, but the front is likely to stall out over
South Florida sometime Saturday evening. A disturbance over Mexico
is forecast to track into the Gulf of Mexico late Saturday and
ignite heavy showers and thunderstorms over southern Florida on
Mother's Day.

The weather pattern the next several days is summarized with an
amplifying jet stream pattern across North America. Along and east
of the Mississippi River, an Arctic air-mass is expected to usher
in cold temperatures and blustery conditions this weekend.
Numerous Freeze Warnings and Watches have been posted from the
Midwest to the Northeast with record low temperatures possible
over the weekend, most notably Saturday morning. In addition to
the winter-like temperatures parts of the Great Lakes,
Appalachians, and Northeast can expect snow to fall Friday evening

intensifies off the New England coast Saturday morning. Snow could
fall heavily at times with several inches of accumulating snowfall
in the northern Appalachians and northern Maine. Temperatures will
moderate slightly but remain well below normal across much of the
eastern U.S. on Mother's Day.

While moms in the East are trying to keep warm, moms in the West

damaging wind with isolated large hail.  The heavy rain associated
with the storms may produce localized isolated flash flooding on

Advisories are in effect this morning from the Midwest to the
Northeast. Record low max and min temperatures are expected across
much of the East today with the potential for more record lows in
the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic Mother's Day morning. In addition
to the cold, a rapidly developing coastal low is going to make for
a snowy day in Maine where Winter Storm Warnings and Winter
Weather Advisories are in place. Scattered rain and snow showers
are also possible across the Northeast and eastern Great Lakes
throughout the day Saturday. The cold weather refuses to back down
in the Midwest and northern High Plains on Mother's Day as yet
another round of brisk and March-like temperatures takes hold of
these regions in wake of a passing cold front. This cold front is
forecast to reinforce the abnormally cold air-mass in the eastern
U.S. to kick-off the upcoming week.

While moms in the East try to stay warm, moms in the West will
bask a more summer-like temperature regime this weekend. Record
high max and min temperatures are possible up and down the West

...Great Lakes system to reach the Northeast on Monday, more
showers and thunderstorms to develop over the Southern and Central
Plains...

...Cooler and wetter conditions return to the West Coast Monday
and Tuesday, eastern regions to remain cooler then normal through
Tuesday...

The nation's Mother's Day forecast spotlights the continuation of
April to even March-like temperatures from the front range of the
Great Plains to the East Coast. Portions of the Central Plains,
Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Ohio/Tennessee Valleys are under
Freeze Warnings or Frost Advisories this morning with some record
breaking lows also possible. Meanwhile, the western third of the
CONUS stays under a more summer-like regime for one more day with
the potential for some record breaking high temps.
Precipitation-wise, a storm system tracking through the Great
Lakes today will spark showers and thunderstorms across the region
with a chance for some severe weather. Scattered showers and
thunderstorms are likely in parts of the Southwest and southern
High Plains this afternoon and evening. Florida can also expect
showers and storms as a wave of low pressure tracks along a
stalled frontal boundary stretching from the Gulf of Mexico to the
northern Bahamas. Rainfall could be heavy at times and storms
could be severe across South Florida.

The aforementioned Great Lakes system takes aim at the Northeast
on Monday where it will induce more showers across the region.
Some of the highest elevations of the central and northern
Appalachians could pick up some light snow accumulations Sunday
night into Monday. Plus, the is also the potential for severe
weather in southern New England where a Marginal risk has been
issued by the Storm Prediction Center. Speaking of severe weather,
another round of severe storms are possible in the southern High
Plains on Monday with hit-or-miss showers and storms possible
throughout the Intermountain West. 

The stretch of sizzling temperatures over the western third of the
U.S. will come to an end starting Monday as a Pacific storm system
approaches California. The storm system will introduce cooler air
to the West Coast on Monday and push farther inland into the Great
Basin by Tuesday. The Pacific Northwest should also receive
beneficial rainfall from this storm system as it advects moisture
overhead the first half of the week. Despite the cooler regime
beginning to take shape out West, eastern and central regions can
not shake the cooler than normal temperatures just yet with more
record breaking lows possible Tuesday morning in the Great Lakes,
Ohio Valley, and Mid-Atlantic."

...Rain and thunderstorms to develop across the Pacific
Northwest/Northern California and the Southern/Central Plains
Monday and Tuesday, South Florida also stays wet...

...Low pressure system may spark thunderstorms in New England
today with a light wintry mix or snow on the backside...

To start the week, much of the central and eastern U.S. will
remain mired in a prolonged stretch of colder than average
temperatures. Record cold minimum and maximum temperatures should
be set from the Plains all the way to the Eastern Seaboard both
Monday and Tuesday. Freeze Warnings and Frost Advisories are in
effect across parts of the Midwest, with additional Freeze
Warnings and Watches across the Appalachians into parts of the
Northeast. Meanwhile in the West, warmer than average temperatures
are expected to continue across the Great Basin and Four Corners
regions. Warm and windy conditions are a recipe for fire weather
concerns in the Southwest, resulting in the issuance of a Critical
Risk by the Storm Prediction Center both Monday and Tuesday.
Temperatures along the West Coast are forecast to trend cooler on
Tuesday as a Pacific storm system advances inland on Tuesday.

The upper-level low coming into the West will also lead to
increasing chances for rainfall in the Pacific Northwest and
northern California on Monday into Tuesday, with the heaviest
rainfall amounts along the northern California and southern Oregon
coast. Higher elevations of the Cascades, Sierra Nevada, and then
into the Northern Rockies could see some light snow from this
storm system. The Northern High Plains may also see a couple of
rounds of wintry weather on the cold side of a front draped across
the Intermountain West through Tuesday. As upper-level energy
moves eastward, odds of spotty showers and thunderstorms will ramp
up over the Central and Southern Plains Monday and Tuesday.
Rainfall totals between 1-2 inches with locally higher amounts
could lead to isolated areas of flash flooding. Additionally,
portions of the Florida peninsula are expected to dry out after
this evening's rain, but showers and thunderstorms will linger
over South Florida through Tuesday with a couple of frontal
systems nearby.

Farther east, a low pressure system has its sights set on the
Northeast today. Thunderstorms are forecast ahead of this low,
some of which could be strong to severe in southern New England
where a Marginal Risk has been posted by the Storm Prediction
Center. Another round of light wintry mixed precipitation or snow
is also possible for the Central Appalachians and parts of the
interior Northeast behind the low. Drier conditions will take hold
of the Northeast by Wednesday morning as high pressure centered
over the Great Lakes begins to build in overhead."

...Increasingly active weather pattern developing in the Plains
and Midwest with rounds of severe weather and bouts of heavy
rain...

...Temperatures to average 10 to 20 degrees below normal from the
Mississippi River to the East Coast, cool Tuesday in the Plains
gives way to warmer weather by Wednesday...

...Periods of rain in the Northwest, critical fire weather
conditions in parts of the Southwest and southern High Plains...

The weather pattern across the Lower 48 is showing signs of
breaking down the stagnant ""warm West, cool East"" regime as the
jet stream becomes more zonal from coast to coast. This means more
upper-level disturbances tracking from western regions into the
Heartland through mid-week. Today, showers and thunderstorms are
forecast to develop over the Northern Rockies as a low pressure
system tracks through the Intermountain West. Additionally, storms
should fire in the South Central U.S. Tuesday evening. As the low
tracks into the Plains on Wednesday, the dry line in the Southern
Plains will spark thunderstorms that are likely to become severe.
The Storm Prediction Center has Enhanced and Slight Risks issued
for the Southern and Central Plains. Showers and storms are also
possible in the Upper Mississippi Valley to the north of the low
emerging into the Northern Plains. By Thursday morning, the storm
system will traverse the Midwest where heavy showers and storms
are possible, along with perhaps another round of severe weather
in the Central and Southern Plains later in the day.

Farther east, a dome of high pressure will have a strong grip over
much of the eastern third of the country. Temperatures remain
chilly for mid-May with more record cold minimum and maximum
temperatures possible today from the Arkansas River Valley and the
Upper Midwest to the Northeast. Freeze Warnings and Frost
Advisories are also in effect for portions of these regions. Parts
of the Plains begin to warm up by Wednesday but cooler
temperatures stick around across the northeastern quarter of the
CONUS. As a warm front lifts northward Thursday, temperatures will
rebound to seasonally warmer levels throughout the Mid-South and
Mid-Atlantic. In addition to the warmer temperatures, much of the
East Coast can expect little in the way of precipitation thanks to
the influence of high pressure overhead.

While eastern regions begin to warm up and stay mostly dry, the
West Coast and most notably the Northwest will witness cooler and
wetter conditions through mid-week. This is due to an upper-level
low off the Pacific Northwest coast that should stick around for a
couple days. This pattern is a welcome sight providing beneficial
rainfall to drought stricken areas of the Northwest. Speaking of
""drought stricken"", the dry conditions combined with hot and gusty
conditions will make for increased fire weather concerns from
southeastern Nevada and to Oklahoma and Texas Panhandles. Critical
fire weather areas have been issued in these areas as well as the
central Four Corners region."

...Pattern change across much of the nation with warmer weather
for the eastern U.S. and unsettled conditions from the southern
Plains to the Great Lakes...

The deep upper level trough that has been anchored over the
eastern U.S. and much of Canada has resulted in a late season
freeze for many areas, especially from the Ohio Valley to the
Northeast states.  Temperatures have been running a good 10 to 20
degrees below normal over the past couple of days, and another
night of unseasonably cold temperatures is expected for this same
general area along with some record lows.  With Canadian high
pressure overhead and calm to light winds, frost and freeze
advisories/warnings are in effect from Wisconsin to Maine, and
extending south to the central Appalachians and northern portions
of the Mid-Atlantic.  These cold conditions will be a thing of the
past by the end of the week as a strong warm front lifts through
the region ahead of the next storm system, and this will herald
the arrival of above normal temperatures by Friday as an upper
level ridge builds in.

With the Pacific front crossing the Intermountain West and then
emerging across the Plains by Thursday, a corridor of enhanced
moisture from the Gulf of Mexico will surge northward ahead of the
front and on the western periphery of the surface high that will
establish residence over the Southeastern U.S.  Multiple
disturbances along the front and shortwaves aloft will provide
multiple rounds of showers and storms going through the middle of
the week, and some of these storms could be severe, particularly
across parts of western Texas and Oklahoma where an Enhanced Risk
of severe weather exists on Wednesday near the dryline.  Flooding
may also be a concern across portions of the Midwest by Thursday
with widespread 1 to 2 inch rainfall amounts likely.

Elsewhere across the continental U.S., heavy showers are likely
from northwest California to western Washington near the Coastal
Ranges and the foothills of the Cascades with a steady onshore
flow through midweek.  Dry and warm conditions are expected to
continue for the southwestern quadrant of the U.S., and this also
holds true for much of the Southeast states.  With the exception
of some heavier showers and storms for South Florida, most of the
Sunshine State should live up to its nickname with high pressure
governing the overall weather pattern."

...Pattern change across much of the nation to generate warmer
weather in the East, severe weather and heavy rain from the
southern Plains to the Great Lakes, and beneficial rainfall in the
Northwest...

The extended stretch of abnormally cold conditions from the
Midwest and Ohio Valley to the Northeast is on the verge of
ending. As cold Canadian high pressure remains entrenched over
these regions, Freeze Warnings and Frost Advisories extend from
the shores of Lake Michigan to the New England coast this morning.
Temperature anomalies today should range between 10 to 20 degrees
below normal for these areas. As a warm front to the south begins
its trek north, temperatures will soar to much warmer levels by
Thursday with parts of the Ohio Valley making a run at 80 degrees
on Thursday. It will be the Mid-Atlantic's and Northeast's turn to
welcome a surge of warmer than normal temperatures by Friday.

The pattern change across the Lower 48 also refers to a more
active storm track across the central U.S. today and into the
second half of the week. A pair of upper-level troughs out West
will work in tandem with a strengthening high pressure system over
the Southeast to funnel Gulf of Mexico moisture northward into the
Nation's Heartland. Episodes of severe weather are likely from the
southern and central Plains to the Great Lakes highlighted with an
Enhanced Risk today in northwest Texas and western Oklahoma.
Excessive rainfall is also on the table from the Midwest to the
Great Lakes with a Slight Risk in place for Thursday. Rainfall
totals could range between 1 to 2 inches with locally higher
amounts possible.

Elsewhere across the CONUS, rounds of heavy showers are likely
from far northwest California to western Washington as steady
onshore flow brings beneficial rainfall to drought stricken areas
of the Pacific Northwest. Speaking of ""drought stricken"", dry and
warm conditions continue for the southwestern quadrant of the U.S.
that support elevated and critical fire weather conditions in the
Four Corners region and southern High Plains. Dry conditions are
also anticipated throughout much of the Southeast as high pressure
dominates the region the rest of the week. The lone exception to
this dry pattern is down in South Florida and the Florida Keys
where a stalled frontal boundary is likely to keep scattered
showers and storms in the forecast through week's end."

The weather pattern the remainder of the work-week will be
characterized by high pressure over near the Southeast coast and
waves of upper-level disturbances traversing the northern U.S.
within zonal flow aloft. This allows for a channeling of Gulf of
Mexico moisture into the Heartland and Great Lakes today and into
the start of the weekend. Thunderstorms and showers are expected

rainfall is in place over northern Missouri while Slight Risks for
both severe weather and excessive rainfall have been issued today
from the Central Plains to the Lower Great Lakes. This same storm
system will then head for the Northeast on Friday, thus shifting
the severe threat into the region. Meanwhile, a cold front over
the Middle Mississippi Valley is expected to trigger additional
showers and thunderstorms on Friday before stalling over the
region early Saturday. The Southern Plains are primed for more
thunderstorms today and persisting into Saturday, some of which
could be severe.

After a remarkably chilly start to May for much of the East,
summer-like conditions return starting today in the Ohio Valley as
a warm front lifts north of the region. To the east, a cool and
crisp Thursday morning is on tap across the Northeast with daytime
highs still on the seasonally cool side. As a warm front to the
south heads to the north tonight, it will be the Mid-Atlantic's
turn to welcome a surge of warmer than normal temperatures on
Friday. The Mid-Atlantic should expect another warm day on
Saturday while New England contends with yet another day of cooler
temperatures thanks to a cold frontal passage Friday night.

Elsewhere, rounds of showers are likely from far northwest
California to western Washington today as steady onshore flow
brings beneficial rainfall to drought stricken areas of the
Pacific Northwest. A brief bubble of high pressure will build in
on Friday before another push of precipitation arrives this

Additionally, heavy rain of 1 to 3 inches could cause flash
flooding over portions of Texas and Oklahoma. Heavy rain will move
slowly eastward over the weekend, moving into the Lower
Mississippi Valley by Sunday.

Ahead of a frontal system, thunderstorms are likely across
portions of the Ohio Valley to the Northeast this evening into
tonight. Severe weather is forecast, with an Enhanced Risk
outlined by the Storm Prediction Center for parts of New York and
New England. Tornadoes, high winds, and hail are all threats with
these storms. The front is expected to push southward and then
meander across the Mid-Atlantic over the weekend, connected to a
surface low that will strengthen over the Midwest Saturday into
Sunday. Rain and thunderstorms should increase in coverage with
this low, and locally heavy rainfall and strong to severe storms
are possible for the Midwest, Great Lakes, and Ohio Valley over
the weekend. Cooler than normal temperatures are forecast from the
Northern/Central Plains to Upper Great Lakes behind the low, but
farther west over the Great Basin and Rockies, upper-level ridging
will lead to high temperatures around 15 degrees above normal.

The National Hurricane Center is monitoring a low pressure system
with tropical characteristics over southern Florida. This could
become the first tropical or subtropical cyclone for the 2020
season. The low is expected to track north-northeastward, east of
the Florida peninsula. Regardless of tropical development, heavy
rainfall and gusty winds are possible across the Florida Keys and
portions of southeastern Florida. Please see the National
Hurricane Center's website for more information.

In the West, an approaching upper-level low and associated front

could receive 1 to 2 inches of rain with locally higher amounts.
So Slight Risks of excessive rainfall/flash flooding are also in
place there tonight and into Sunday. Closer to the low, rainfall
amounts of 2 to 3 inches should be widespread from the Midwest to
Great Lakes and parts of the Upper Ohio Valley. Slight Risks of
flash flooding are outlooked for those areas as well over the next
couple days considering those rainfall amounts, and strong to
severe thunderstorms cannot be ruled out. Cool temperatures are
expected behind this low.

The National Hurricane Center has determined that the low pressure
system east of Florida is now Tropical Depression One. The
depression is forecast to strengthen to a tropical storm tonight
and move northward through Monday. This is expected to affect the
North Carolina coast with heavy rain, tropical-storm-force winds,
dangerous surf, and rip currents. Please see the National
Hurricane Center for more information on this system.

A deep upper-level low is expected to approach the West over the
next couple of days, pushing a frontal system eastward across the
Pacific Northwest and into the Great Basin and California. This
will cause increasing precipitation chances for those areas.
Through Monday evening, rainfall of 1 to 3 inches is forecast for
portions of northern California and western Oregon. Most
precipitation should fall as rain, but higher elevations of the
Sierra Nevada could receive a few inches of snow. Additionally,
high temperatures are expected to be 10 to 20 degrees below normal
for northern California and parts of Oregon on Sunday, spreading
south and east Monday.

In between the upper-level low in the West and the system in the
eastern half of the country, upper-level ridging is expected
across the Great Basin into the Rockies and Plains. This will lead
to temperatures that are above normal by 10 to 20 degrees in those
areas underneath the ridge. The dry, hot conditions could also
cause fire danger, and the Storm Prediction Center has Elevated to
Critical Risks for fire weather in place on Sunday and Monday for
portions of the Southwest, Central Great Basin, and Four Corners."

those regions. On Monday the heavy rain will be over the parts of
Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, Tennessee Valley, and Southern
Appalachians. 

The National Hurricane Center has determined that the low pressure
system east of Florida is now Tropical Storm Arthur and is
forecast to move northeastward way from the U. S. Coast. The
eastern end of the aforementioned system will be a front over the
Mid-Atlantic and as Arthur moves northeastward and associated
region of tropical moisture will move into the front aiding in the
development of showers and thunderstorms with associated heavy
rain over the Mid-Atlantic on Monday into Tuesday.  Furthermore,
Arthur will produce heavy rain, tropical-storm-force winds,
dangerous surf, and rip currents along the North Carolina Coast on
Monday.  Please see the National Hurricane Center for more
information on this system.

A deep upper-level low is expected to approach the West Coast

A cut-off upper level low is dousing the Ohio Valley and southern
Mid-Atlantic with bands of heavy showers and thunderstorms. The
storm system's seemingly endless supply of moisture and slow
movement is a recipe for flooding concerns in these regions
through mid-week. Moderate Risks for excessive rainfall remain in
place for the eastern Ohio Valley and southern Appalachians this
evening. The heavy rain threat becomes more focused in the
southern Mid-Atlantic tomorrow where a Moderate Risk fore
excessive rainfall is also present. There is also the potential
for some severe weather in portions of the Southeast this evening
and again on Wednesday. By Thursday evening, rainfall amounts
could exceed seven inches in parts of the southern Appalachians.
River flooding in parts of southeast Virginia and the western
Carolinas could become increasingly problematic late week.

While Arthur looks to track further south and east away from the
U.S. over the next couple days, the pressure gradient it and the
upper low over the southeast is generating with strong high
pressure to the north sets the stage for prolonged onshore winds
along the Mid-Atlantic coast. Coastal flood warnings and
advisories continue for the Virginia Tidewater and much of the
lower DelMarVa peninsula. Potential impacts include flooded roads,
beach erosion, and inundated homes and businesses.

Farther west, severe weather is forecast to become a daily
occurrence in the Great Plains through week's end. A cold front
should trigger strong-to-severe storms in western Montana and
north-central Idaho this evening. Meanwhile, a slow progressing
frontal boundary will be the catalyst for thunderstorms up and
down the High Plains today, Wednesday, and again on Thursday. The
front's slow nature could also lead to flash flooding concerns in
the northern and central High Plains. To the south, dry and windy

A stalled upper-level low over the Mid-South continues its
onslaught of heavy rain over the southern Appalachians and
Mid-Atlantic. Rainfall rates will become excessive within bands of
embedded thunderstorms. The storm's seemingly endless supply of
moisture, its slow movement, and the region's overly saturated
soil are a recipe for significant flooding tonight and into
Thursday. Flash Flood Watches remain in effect for parts of the
eastern Ohio Valley, southwest Virginia, and much of the western
Carolinas. High risks for excessive rainfall are forecast for the
Southern Appalachians of North Carolina and southwest Virginia
through Thursday morning where widespread flash flooding is
likely. Landslides and debris flows are possible within steeper
terrain. Storm total rainfall amounts could exceed ten inches in

possible along the coastal Carolinas and into southern Georgia
this evening and into Thursday. In addition, brisk onshore winds
responsible for coastal flooding in the Virginia Tidewater, the
lower DelMarVa Peninsula, and North Carolina Outer Banks will
gradually weaken overnight.

In the Heartland, rounds of severe storms are expected to develop
up and down the Great Plains this evening and through Friday. This
is due to the combination of a slow progressing frontal boundary
to the north and the dry line to the south acting as triggers for
thunderstorms up and down the High Plains this evening and again
on Thursday. The front's slow progression could also lead to flash
flooding concerns in areas impacted by heavy thunderstorms. To the

In the West, an upper level trough is swinging through the
northern Rockies this afternoon with scattered heavy showers and
thunderstorms dotting parts of the Northwest. Rainfall rates could

concern farther inland across the Piedmont into the Blue Ridge
Mountains where copious amounts of rain have already fallen over
the past few days. The widespread heavy rain threat will diminish
on Friday into Saturday but scattered thunderstorms will still be
present which may exacerbate ongoing flooding across the region.

Over the Great Plains, a slow moving warm front and dryline will
serve as foci for strong to severe thunderstorms over the next two
days. High low level moisture with origins from the Gulf of Mexico
and a favorable jet orientation aloft will help contribute to
daily chances of convection from portions of Kansas into Oklahoma
and Texas through Saturday. The Storm Prediction Center has a
Slight Risks for severe thunderstorms over northwestern Oklahoma
into western Kansas as well as western Texas this evening and
tonight, with another Slight Risk on Friday farther east for
portions of the Ozarks into northern Texas. In addition to threats
of tornadoes, straight line winds and hail, flash flooding may
accompany these thunderstorms producing a few inches of rain over
a relatively short time frame.

Below average temperatures will be in store for the northwestern
U.S. as well as the northern Great Basin over the next few days
owing to a large upper level trough over the western U.S. with a
series of impulses moving through the region. High temperatures
are expected to run 10 to 20 degrees below average on Friday and
Saturday across much of the northwestern quadrant of the country,

Slight Risk of excessive rainfall in place. Ahead of an
upper-level trough and another frontal system, storms are expected
farther north on Saturday across the Northern/Central Plains. A
Slight Risk of severe weather is in place, and locally heavy
rainfall could cause flash flooding particularly over western
South Dakota.

As below normal upper-level heights take over the northwestern
U.S., cold temperatures with highs 10 to 25 degrees below normal
will prevail in the Northwest today and move a bit eastward toward
the Northern Rockies Saturday. This will support snow falling in
higher elevations of the Northern Rockies--over a foot of snow is
forecast for some areas across the Absaroka Range and Wind River
Mountains through Sunday morning.

Farther south, dry and windy conditions are expected, which will
cause fire danger over southwestern and south-central parts of the
country. A Critical Risk of fire weather is expected today over
portions of the Southwest to Four Corners region, and on Saturday,
the focus should shift to the Southern High Plains behind a
dryline. Red Flag Warnings are in effect for some of these areas,
and also for much of Maine today, where low relative humidities
and gusty winds are also possible.

Elsewhere, a low pressure system is forecast to slowly move
through the Mid-Atlantic and then offshore on Saturday, and

southward.

Behind the cold front, cooler than average temperatures are
expected to spread from the northern and central Rockies toward
the central and southern High Plains.  Over the higher elevations
of Wyoming and Colorado, temperatures will be cold enough to
support wet snow especially in the late night and early morning

...Heavy rain forecast for Florida...

A well-defined but slow-moving cold front will continue advancing
across the Plains and Four Corners region through the remainder of
Memorial Day weekend. Ahead of this front, warmer than average
temperatures and sufficient moisture should lead to scattered to
widespread thunderstorms across the Plains and Mississippi Valley.
Today, a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms is in place from the
Southern/Central Plains into the Middle/Upper Mississippi Valley,
and very large hail is a threat. Slight Risks of excessive
rainfall/flash flooding are also in effect for the Central Plains
to Middle Mississippi Valley and for parts of Texas today.
Tomorrow, heavy rainfall causing flash flooding is expected for
the Southern Plains, with widespread rainfall of 1 to 3 inches,
with locally higher amounts.

Behind this cold front, high temperatures are forecast to be 10 to
20 degrees below average over the Northern/Central Rockies and
High Plains today. The cold will support a few additional inches
of snow for higher elevations of the Northern Rockies today, while
snow in the Central Rockies could approach a foot through tonight.
Cooler than average temperatures should move southward into the
Central/Southern High Plains on Monday as the front progresses.
Farther south, elevated fire weather danger remains a threat today
for much of New Mexico and eastern Arizona. Additionally, heat is
forecast to build in across the West underneath an upper-level
ridge beginning on Memorial Day, but increasing substantially
closer to midweek.

Copious amounts of moisture along with a tropical wave that could
produce a surface low will support the development of heavy
rainfall across Florida over the next couple of days. Rainfall
amounts could be high over the Keys and southern Florida
today--over 4 inches are possible. Then potentially heavy rain
could extend across much of the peninsula tomorrow. Flood Watches
and Slight Risks of excessive rainfall are in place to cover the
threat over southern Florida."

A slow-moving cold front with multiple low pressure waves will
continue to help trigger clusters of strong to severe
thunderstorms from the Plains eastward into the southern half of
the Appalachians through this evening.  As the front continues to
advance down the Plains, the highest chance of thunderstorms and
heavy rain will shift southward into the southern Plains on
Memorial Day, where generally a couple inches of rain with locally
higher amounts can be expected.

Ahead of the cold front, warmer than average temperatures are
expected to spread across the Great Lakes toward New England. 
High temperatures in interior New England could soar well up into
the 80s by Tuesday afternoon. In contrast, high-elevation snows
across parts of the northern and central Rockies will taper off
this evening.  The core of the cold air will continue to spread
southeastward into the central/southern High Plains on Monday and
into Texas on Tuesday.  Meanwhile, heat is forecast to build
across the West underneath an expanding upper-level ridge.  Daily
record high temperatures will be in jeopardy over interior
California beginning on Memorial Day before the heat intensifies
and expands into the Great Basin and the Desert Southwest on
Tuesday.  Farther east, fire danger remains elevated into tonight
for much of New Mexico and eastern Arizona.

Tropical moisture streaming up from the Caribbean Sea will

A front is forecast to continue slowly moving across the Plains
over the next couple of days, and should provide a focus for
strong to severe thunderstorms that could cause flash flooding for
the parts of the Plains and Mississippi Valley. For Memorial Day,
a Slight Risk of flash flooding extends through much of Texas into
eastern portions of Oklahoma and Kansas and western portions of
the Mississippi Valley. Severe weather is forecast to focus mainly
in Texas, but strong storms cannot be ruled out northward to the
Great Lakes region. Then on Tuesday, the heaviest rainfall totals
are expected in the Ark-La-Tex, so flash flooding is again
possible there. Scattered showers and thunderstorms could also
occur farther east into the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys and the
Southeast.

Over portions of Florida, ample tropical moisture flowing in plus
a trough will lead to widespread heavy rainfall of 2 to 4 inches
through tonight, with locally higher amounts. A Moderate Risk of
excessive rainfall is in place for the Atlantic side of the state,
and Flood Watches are in effect as well. Some lighter rainfall is
expected to spread toward the Georgia and South Carolina coast on
Tuesday.

Hot temperatures will be another threat across the country over
the next several days. Warmth is expected to build underneath two
upper-level ridges, one in the West and one in the East. Excessive
heat is possible for California today spreading into the Southwest
Tuesday and across much of the West later in the week. Widespread
record high maximum and minimum temperatures will be set.
Meanwhile, the Great Lakes region should see high temperatures 10
to 20 degrees above normal today and Tuesday, and record highs are
possible there as well as temperatures soar well into the 80s. In
between, a slow-moving upper-level low should cause below normal

Over portions of Florida, an area of disturbed weather associated
with a low pressure area in the eastern Gulf of Mexico will lead
to widespread heavy rainfall through tonight.  A Moderate Risk of
excessive rainfall is in place for the Atlantic side of the state
where the strongest onshore flow resides, and Flood Watches are in
effect.  Moderate to heavy rainfall is expected to spread toward
the Georgia and the coast of the Carolinas through Wednesday as
the low pressure system drifts across the Florida Peninsula
offshore the Southeast before weakening near the Georgia and South
Carolina coasts as it becomes embedded within a frontal zone/the
leading edge of a wedge of cool high pressure east of the
Appalachians and dampens out with time.  The associated flash
flood risk is considered marginal there on Tuesday and Wednesday
as the heaviest rainfall is expected to remain offshore.

A front is forecast to meander across the Plains/Midwest through
Wednesday, providing a focus for strong to severe thunderstorms
that could cause flash flooding for the parts of the Plains and
Mississippi Valley.  A broad swath of the region has flash flood
watches in effect from the ArkLaTex northward though Kansas City
into Nebraska.  Severe weather is forecast to focus mainly in
Texas Monday afternoon and evening, but strong storms cannot be
ruled out northward to the Great Lakes region on the top ridge of
a Northeastern ridge.  On Tuesday, the heaviest rainfall totals
are expected in the ArkLaTex, where flash flooding will remain
possible. Scattered showers and thunderstorms could also occur
farther east into the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys and the Southeast.

Hot temperatures will be seen across portions of the United States
through Wednesday.  Heat is expected to build under two
upper-level ridges, under the one in the West and the northern
portion of the other in the Great Lakes & New York. Excessive heat
is possible for California Monday afternoon and evening spreading
into the Southwest Tuesday and across much of the West through the
remainder of the week. Widespread record hot low and high
temperatures will be set. Meanwhile, the Great Lakes region,
including portions of New York, should see high temperatures 10 to

western portions of the Lower/Middle Mississippi Valley, as those
areas have been wet recently. Severe weather is expected to focus
farther north today, with a Slight Risk in place from the Storm
Prediction Center across parts of the Upper Mississippi Valley.
Then tomorrow, a Slight Risk of severe weather is outlooked for
central Texas.

A low pressure system is expected to lift northeastward across
Florida today and into South Carolina by Wednesday. Ample tropical
moisture streaming into the system will lead to rain and
thunderstorms; the heaviest rain should remain offshore today, but
the Georgia and South Carolina coasts could receive over an inch
of rain, and so could southeastern Florida. Then on Wednesday,
rain of 1 to 2 inches with locally higher amounts is forecast for
portions of the Carolinas and into western parts of Virginia. A
Slight Risk of excessive rainfall/flash flooding is in place for
those areas.

The upper-level pattern across the country consisting of a ridge

Great Lakes region. A Slight Risk of excessive rainfall is in
place there tomorrow.

A surface low pressure system is expected to drift northward
across coastal Georgia and South Carolina today as tropical
moisture flows into the region. This will lead to rainfall totals
of 1 to 2 inches, with locally higher amounts, over portions of
the Carolinas and western Virginia into the Appalachians through

After making landfall as a Tropical Storm earlier today, now
Tropical Depression Bertha is expected to track northwest
escorting tropical moisture northward into the southern
Mid-Atlantic. In fact, the southern Appalachians and Shenandoah
Valley are most at risk for flooding due to the overly saturated
soil from recent heavy rainfall and rainfall rates becoming more
intense where orographic lift is maximized. As a result, a
Moderate Risk for excessive rainfall is in place in southwest
Virginia and far northwest North Carolina tonight. In addition, a
Slight Risk for excessive rainfall and a swath of Flash Flood
watches extend from southeast West Virginia to the coasts of
southern North Carolina and northeast South Carolina. Rainfall
amounts could exceed several inches in the southern Appalachians
and along the coastline of South Carolina and southern North
Carolina. By Thursday morning Bertha's circulation is forecast to
end up in eastern West Virginia where it will be wet and anything
but wonderful as widespread showers, some heavy at times, drench
much of the state. The storm's remnants also usher a tropical
air-mass into the Mid-Atlantic with warm and humid conditions
surging up the East Coast with spotty showers and storms from the
Southeast to southern New England. The tropical air-mass will
engulf the Eastern Seaboard Friday but relief in the form of a
cold front will provide relief in lower dew points and cooler
temperatures by the weekend.

Speaking of showers and thunderstorms, there is no shortage of
showers and storms this afternoon in the Mississippi Valley thanks
to an upper low over the region and an elongated frontal boundary
stretching from east Texas to the northern Great Lakes. Severe
weather is anticipated in the Lone Star state where central Texas
is under an Enhanced Risk for severe weather this evening. A cold
front sweeping across the Midwest on Thursday forces the upper low
to pick up the pace late Thursday resulting in the severe threat
encompassing much of the South. A Slight Risk for excessive
rainfall is also in place the western Great Lakes on Thursday as
rainfall rates could become heavy. By Friday, the aforementioned
cold front's passage will make for a drier Friday across the
Midwest while areas of showers and storms develop in the hot and
humid air-mass over the Ohio Valley and Northeast.

In the West, an upper-level ridge refuses to loosen its grip over
the western third of the country through Thursday. High
temperatures should be roughly 10 to 20 degrees above average over
California, the Southwest, and the Great Basin. More record high
max and high minimum temperatures are likely on Thursday and
Excessive Heat Warnings and Heat Advisories remain in effect with
temperatures surpassing the century mark in some areas. By Friday,
the heat becomes increasingly stifling in the Great Basin and
Snake River Valley where high temps make a run at the upper 90s.
On the flip side, below normal temperatures and more comfortable
humidity levels arrive in the Midwest and Great Lakes on Friday."

Though Bertha is becoming post-tropical, its low pressure system
is expected to track northward across the Appalachians today,
spreading tropical moisture across the Eastern Seaboard. Rain and
thunderstorms should continue today over portions of the Southeast
and Mid-Atlantic. As some of these areas have already received
copious amounts of rainfall over the last several days, flooding
and flash flooding could be a threat, especially over portions of
the eastern Carolinas and Virginia, where there is a Slight Risk
of exessive rainfall in place today. Bertha is expected to
dissipate by tonight.

Scattered showers and thunderstorms are forecast once again today
across the central and eastern U.S. underneath a persistent
upper-level low. Strong to severe thunderstorms are most likely
over parts of southern Texas and the central Gulf states, where
Slight Risks of severe weather have been outlined by the Storm
Prediction Center. This upper low will finally lift north and
combine with the main jet stream on Friday. At the surface, a cold
front is forecast to move across the Midwest today and provide a

Slight Risk of excessive rainfall/flash flooding is in place from
the Middle Mississippi Valley into the Upper Great Lakes. Then on
Friday as the front moves into the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic,
severe weather is a threat for those regions as organized
convection could form. Locally heavy rainfall and isolated
flooding are also possible there. Behind the cold front, the
central U.S. should finally dry out Friday into Saturday.

Heat will be persistent in the West, with high temperatures 15 to
25 degrees above average across California, the Great Basin, and
the Southwest over the next couple of days. Daily record
temperatures should be set in these areas as temperatures exceed
100 degrees in many places. Heat Advisories and Excessive Heat

A potent upper-level low slamming into California this afternoon
will head north this evening with heavy showers and thunderstorms
developing out ahead of it. This storm system is responsible for
several weather hazards, most notably the threats for severe
weather and excessive rainfall. Central Oregon and central
Washington are now under both Severe Thunderstorm and Flash Flood
Watches through this evening. Parts of northern California and the
northern Rockies could also contend with heavy rain and strong
thunderstorms. In addition to precipitation, strong winds are
likely across the Great Basin where High Wind Warnings and Wind
Advisories are in place. The combination of brisk winds and low
humidity levels are a recipe for critical fire weather conditions
throughout the weekend in the Great Basin and Colorado River
Valley. The storm system quickly races northward tonight and by
Sunday scattered showers and thunderstorms should be confined to
northern Washington, northern Idaho, and northwest Montana.

One more day of record breaking heat in the Snake River Valley
this afternoon before cooler temperatures arrive throughout the
Northwest on Sunday. Sizzling temperatures set up shop over the
northern and central Rockies and High Plains where some daily
record high temps are possible. A couple daily record high temps
could also be set in the Arizona Desert as Excessive Heat warnings
continue into Sunday. The regime of much above normal temperatures
heads east on Monday with heat indices approaching the century
mark in the northern Plains and Upper Midwest. While the North
Central region bakes the Great Lakes, Northeast, and on south into
the Carolinas will witness substantially cooler temperatures.
Daily temperature departures are forecast to range between 5 to 15
degrees below normal both Sunday and Monday. Seasonally cool
conditions versus normal are also be possible in the Rio Grande
Valley and along the West Coast.

The threat for severe weather and heavy rainfall returns to the
North Central U.S. on Monday as an area of low pressure passes
overhead. To the south, areas of showers and thunderstorms will
dot the central Rockies and Texas where heavy downpours are
possible, along with the potential for some severe weather. A

Upper-level energy over Texas and moisture from the Western Gulf
of Mexico will aid in producing showers and thunderstorms over the
Western Gulf Coast Sunday through Tuesday.  In addition, a front
over the Northern Rockies will slowly move eastward to the Upper
Great Lakes/Upper Mississippi Valley by Tuesday.  The system will

Critical fire weather conditions will develop across eastern
Nevada, western/southern Utah, and northwest Arizona with
south-southwest sustained winds of 15-25 mph and minimum relative
humidity of 8-20% expected across the region.  Elevated fire
weather conditions are expected around the critical area,
extending through Utah into northwest Colorado. These dry/windy
conditions could spread any ongoing fires that were sparked by
recent lightning.

Upper-level troughing over the Lower Great Lakes will aid in

Despite what will generally be a drier than normal pattern across
much of the Lower 48 the next couple days, there will still be
rounds of showers and thunderstorms to contend with. Starting
across the northern tier, a storm system tracking through the
Canadian Prairies is forecast to spark showers and thunderstorms
over the northern High Plains this evening with some storms
potentially becoming severe. By Monday, the area most at risk for
showers and thunderstorms grows from the northern High Plains to
the Upper Midwest. The frontal boundary responsible for Monday's
storms is likely to stall out over the North Central U.S. leading
to yet another round of severe weather on Tuesday. An area of
showers and storms may track into the eastern Great Lakes and
northern Mid-Atlantic early Tuesday morning ahead of an
approaching warm front. Scattered showers and thunderstorms will
be a daily occurrence across Texas and Florida.

It is fitting that as meteorological summer kicks off on Monday,
so will the beginnings of an expansive dome of summer heat across
the CONUS. High temperatures Monday will rise into the 90s across
the northern and central High Plains with more triple digit heat
in the Desert Southwest. Following a cool Monday, the West Coast
should see temperatures return to summer-like levels. The one
region that manages to stay below normal through Tuesday is the
East Coast with the more pleasant and comfortable conditions
centered in the Northeast. By Wednesday, 80s and 90s for highs

The growing area of sweltering temperatures along with relatively
dry and gusty conditions makes fire weather a growing concern,
most notably in the Four Corners and Great Basin regions. Critical
risks for fire weather continue for both today and Monday in the
central Great Basin. Elevated risks for fire weather extend east

A passing frontal system over the North Central U.S. is
responsible for showers and thunderstorms marching across the
western Great Lakes this afternoon. They will continue on their
easterly track through the Great Lakes tonight and reaching
portions of the northern Mid-Atlantic by Tuesday morning. In wake
of this system, an upper-level disturbance passing through
southern Canada will work in tandem with a stalled front over the
Northern Plains and Upper Midwest to trigger additional showers
and storms late Tuesday. With better jet dynamics aloft, severe
weather is likely with damaging winds, large hail, and tornadoes
all possible. Rainfall rates could also be quite high with
localized flash flooding possible. Elsewhere, hit-or-miss showers
and storms should be found across much of the South; from Texas to
Florida. High pressure over the Southeast and Pacific Northwest
through mid-week ensures an otherwise mostly dry pattern across
the Lower 48.

As meteorological summer kicks off today, so too will an expansive
dome of summer heat which quickly moves west to east over the next
couple days. High temperatures will soar into the 90s across the
Northern/Central High Plains and Midwest through Tuesday with
triple digit heat entrenched across the Desert Southwest.
Following a cool Monday, the West Coast should see temperatures

The Storm Prediction Center highlights a large area from the Upper
Midwest to the Great Lakes within a slight to enhanced risk of
severe weather this evening. This area will shift southward into
the Upper Mississippi Valley/Ohio Valley/northern Mid-Atlantic
tomorrow where SPC has a broad slight risk extending along the
frontal boundary. Back towards the west, a secondary slight risk
for severe weather is possible through tomorrow across parts of
the High Plains into the Central Plains ahead of another,
stronger, cold front dropping into the north-central U.S.. The
threat for showers and storms will expand across much of the
country east of the Mississippi River on Thursday as moisture from
the Gulf of Mexico rounds the western side of high pressure in the
Atlantic. Localized heavy rainfall and strong thunderstorms are
possible within a warm and moist airmass.

through much of the weekend ahead of a warm front and the
intensifying low pressure system.  Winds will become strong and
gusty across the northern and central Rockies and into the
northern Plains as the storm center tracks across the region. 
Cold air behind the storm will be ushered across the Pacific
Northwest into the northern Rockies where wet snow could fall
across the higher elevations by Sunday morning.  Meanwhile, a cool
air mass moving across the Great Lakes will break the heat and
humidity across the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic on Sunday.

Excessive heat will continue today across parts of the Southwest
under a strong upper-level ridge.  The persistent hot and dry
conditions will support critical fire danger across the Great
Basin today, before shifting toward the southern Rockies and
easing a bit on Saturday.  A significant cool down is expected to
reach the West Coast by Saturday behind a cold front, and will
continue to penetrate well inland on Sunday.

Father south in Central America, Cristobal has weakened into a
tropical depression over the Yucatan Peninsula.  The depression is
forecast to head north toward the central Gulf Coast during the
next couple of days.  Although the exact track of Cristobal
remains somewhat uncertain at this time, the storm is expected to
expand in size as it intensifies over the Gulf of Mexico. 
Tropical downpours well ahead of the storm could reach many areas

could cause downpours with storms particularly over the Florida
peninsula tonight and into Saturday, with more widespread rain
over the central and eastern Gulf Coast Saturday night and Sunday
as Cristobal approaches. The tropical storm is currently forecast
to make landfall Sunday evening in the central Gulf Coast of
Louisiana. Please see the National Hurricane Center for additional
and updated information on Cristobal.

Scattered thunderstorms are expected over the Eastern Seaboard
back into the Southeast and Lower Mississippi Valley through
tonight, where warm and humid air is present ahead of a cold
front. Locally heavy rain is possible with storms, and the
potential for flooding is greatest across portions of the northern
Mid-Atlantic where soils are already moist. Additionally, a Slight
Risk of severe weather is in place for the Lower Mississippi
Valley today.

A potent upper-level low is forecast to track southeastward into
the western U.S. over the next couple of days, while upper-level
energy moves in from the subtropics as well. This and a frontal
system at the surface will cause increasing precipitation chances
mostly in the form of scattered thunderstorms through Saturday.
Locally heavy rain is possible, with flash flooding not out of the
question. Some snow is even possible, mostly in higher elevations
of the Cascades and Northern Rockies, but snow levels are expected
to lower even over portions of the Great Basin Sunday. Farther
east over the Northern/Central Plains, severe weather will be a
threat both Saturday and Sunday, with Enhanced Risks of severe
weather in place.

The West should see another warm day today, with critical fire
danger, before quite a cooldown over the West Coast Saturday,
pushing the fire danger to eastern Arizona/much of New
Mexico/eastern Colorado. Cooler high temperatures of 15 to 30

eastward to the Florida Panhandle and possibly northern Florida. 
Cristobal is forecast to make landfall on the Louisiana coast
later on Sunday as a tropical storm.  Increasing winds and waves
along with heavy rain will batter the Louisiana coastal sections
on Sunday as the core of Cristobal approaches.  Some isolated
tornadoes are also possible.  By Monday morning, the storm should
continue to track further inland and begins to weaken. 
Nevertheless, very heavy rain can be expected to overspread much
of the lower Mississippi Valley especially for locations just east
of the storm track.

Meanwhile, a cold and broad upper-level low is forecast to replace
the warm ridge of high pressure that has been anchoring over the
western U.S.  This system will also engulf an upper-level low
coming up across the Desert Southwest and help develop a strong
low pressure system across the northern Rockies and northern High
Plains during the weekend.  This will lead to a heightened chance
of strong to severe thunderstorms to move across the northern
Plains through much of the weekend ahead of a warm front.  The low
pressure system will usher in much colder air across the western
U.S.  Temperatures will be cold enough to support snow from the
Cascades to the mountains of northern California, the Great Basin,
and especially the northern Rockies.  In fact, parts of the
northern Rockies in Idaho and western Montana could see heavy snow
by Monday morning, where a foot of accumulation is possible.

The interior western U.S. should cool down to near normal
conditions today, but with critical fire danger continuing for
parts of the area.  Cooler high temperatures of 15 to 30 degrees
below average are forecast to reach the Great Basin on Sunday
behind a sharp cold front.  Meanwhile, high temperatures into the
90s over the central High Plains are forecast to spread northward
into the northern Plains by Sunday ahead of the intensifying low
pressure system."

...Tropical Storm Cristobal to make landfall in Louisiana late

heavy rain, strong wind gusts, coastal flooding, and isolated
tornadoes possible...

Cristobal continues its north heading this afternoon and has its
sights set on the central Gulf Coast tomorrow. Landfall likely
occurs somewhere along the coast of Louisiana late Sunday along
with the threat of tropical storm force winds, torrential
rainfall, potentially life-threatening storm surge, high surf, and
tornadoes.  Due to the storm's broad and asymmetric
characteristics, the worst impacts should set up along the storm's
eastern flank, making far eastern Louisiana, southern Mississippi,
and southern Alabama most at risk for Cristobal's worst impacts.
Latest rainfall forecast call for 6+ inches in the Mississippi
Delta and into southern Mississippi. Heavy rainfall extends as far
east as the Florida where outer bands will generate heavy
downpours. A Slight Risk for flash flooding is in place for much
of northern and central Florida. Cristobal is forecast to head for
the Lower Mississippi Valley on Monday ushering very heavy
rainfall and gusty winds into the region. Several inches of rain
are on tap over eastern Farther north, guidance continues to hint
at the development of a predecessor rain event over the portions
of the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest Monday evening with
anywhere from 1 to 2 inches of rainfall possible.

Cristobal is not the only storm system in town as a potent upper
trough swings through the western U.S. this weekend and into the
start of the upcoming week. Severe weather is likely to set up
shop in the northern High Plains and central Rockies this
afternoon and evening thanks to a strengthening low pressure
system in the Canadian Prairies. By Sunday, the storm's warm
sector moves over the Dakotas and western Minnesota where severe
storms should develop in the afternoon and lasting into the
evening hours. The cold front inches slowly east on Monday and
will act as a catalyst for additional severe storms and heavy
rainfall over the northern and central Plains. Despite the wetter
pattern in the northern Plains look for dry, hot, and windy
conditions in parts of the southern High Plains and Four Corners
region are a recipe for a significant fire weather risk. The
latest fire weather outlook through the remainder of the weekend
include a critical risk from Arizona to Colorado with an extreme
threat for fire weather in southeast Colorado on Sunday.

Temperature-wise, much cooler temperatures than both normal and
recent weeks will engulf the West. Temperatures aloft will be cold
enough to allow for accumulating snowfall in the Bitterroot and
Sawtooth mountain ranges both Sunday and Monday. While parts of
the Northwest witness wintry conditions, summer heat reigns over
the High Plains where high temps in the 90s spread northward into
the northern Plains by Sunday and the Upper Midwest on Monday
ahead of the intensifying low pressure system. Farther south,
triple digits high temps are likely across West Texas on Monday.
Cooler and more comfortable temperatures arrive across the
Northeast tonight with seasonally cool and less humid conditions
on Sunday."

Cristobal has been maintaining tropical storm intensity as it
continues to move toward the central Gulf Coast this Sunday
morning.  Landfall will likely occur on the Louisiana coast around
sunset today.  Winds increasing to tropical storm force together
with torrential rain, high seas, and isolated tornadoes can be
expected to batter the Louisiana coast into tonight.  Squalls and
very heavy downpours associated with the strong rainbands of
Cristobal will likely sweep across southern Mississippi, southern
Alabama, and possibly the western panhandle of Florida this
evening, resulting in flash flooding in parts of the area. 
Cristobal is forecast to head further inland and gradually weaken
while bringing a quick dose of very heavy rain and gusty winds
along and to the west of the Mississippi Valley into Tuesday.

Meanwhile, an anomalously broad and vigorous upper trough for this
time of the year will swing through the western U.S. into the
start of the upcoming week.  Severe weather is likely to shift
further northeast across the northern Plains later today as a low
pressure system intensifies in the Canadian Prairies.  Cold air
behind the low pressure system will support meaningful snowfall
across the higher elevations of the Great Basin, Intermountain
region, and especially for the Bitterroot and Sawtooth mountain
ranges where heavy snow is possible this evening into Monday. 
Across the northern and central Plains, another low pressure
system could form along a slow-moving cold front and will likely
trigger additional severe storms and heavy rainfall for these
areas.  In contrast to the wetter pattern in the northern Plains,
dry and windy conditions will continue to support critical to
extreme fire danger from the southern High Plains and southern
Rockies to the Four Corners region.

Much cooler temperatures behind a strong cold front will engulf
the West and will only lower the fire danger slightly across the
Southwest by Tuesday.  While parts of the Northwest witness wintry
conditions, summer heat will surge up across the northern Plains
today, reaching the Upper Midwest on Monday, and into the Great
Lakes by Tuesday.  Farther south, triple-digit high temperatures
are likely across West Texas on Monday.  Meanwhile, cooler and
more comfortable temperatures across the Northeast today will
gradually warm up and become more humid Monday into Tuesday."

Cristobal makes landfall in Louisiana this afternoon with intense
rain bands and tropical storm force winds battering the central
Gulf Coast. A High Risk for excessive rainfall remains in place
for eastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi along with the
ongoing threat for dangerous coastal flooding along the Central
Gulf Coast through this evening. An additional 2 to 5 inches of
rain is possible in the High Risk areas with localized amounts of
7 inches or more possible. Heavy showers and thunderstorms also
continue across northern and central Florida where torrential
downpours could occur. As the storm moves ashore, Cristobal's
northeast quadrant will also over the central Gulf Coast, thus
leading to the opportunity for tornadoes this evening and
overnight. Cristobal then heads for the Mississippi Delta region
Monday morning, then into the Arkansas later in the day where very
heavy rainfall will keep the threat for flash flooding in the
forecast across much of the Lower Mississippi Valley. Cristobal
becomes post-tropical Tuesday with heavy rain and gusty winds
working there way through the mid-Mississippi Valley and
eventually into the Upper Midwest by Tuesday night.

Cristobal is not the only significant storm system in town as an
anomalously broad and vigorous upper trough for early June swings
through the western and central U.S. the first half of the week. 
Severe storms should develop across the northern Plains this
afternoon as a low pressure system intensifies in the Canadian
Prairies. Cold air behind the low pressure system will support
periods of snow across the higher elevations of the Great Basin,
Intermountain region, and especially for the Bitterroot, Salmon
River, and Sawtooth mountain ranges where heavy snow is possible
this evening into Monday. Across the northern and central Plains,
another low pressure system looks to form along a slow-moving cold
front triggering additional severe storms and heavy rainfall for
these areas. Meanwhile, a drier and windy pattern continues to
support critical to extreme fire danger from the southern High
Plains and southern Rockies to the Four Corners region through
Tuesday.

Temperature-wise, a strong cold front ushers in a very cool
air-mass for early June across the West and will only lower the
fire danger slightly across the Southwest by Tuesday. Temperatures
look to be cold enough that Frost Advisories and Freeze Warnings
have been posted for parts of the Great Basin and Intermountain
West. While parts of the Northwest witness wintry conditions,
summer heat engulfs the Plains today, then into the Upper Midwest
on Monday, and into the Great Lakes by Tuesday. Farther south,
triple-digit high temperatures are likely across western and
central Texas on Monday. Tuesday's heat indices look to range
between 100-110 across east and south Texas. Cooler and more
comfortable temperatures across the Northeast today gradually warm
up and become increasingly more humid Monday into Tuesday."

After making landfall in southeastern Louisiana yesterday,
tropical storm Cristobal has continued to track further inland
into the lower Mississippi Valley.  Cristobal has been weakening
relatively slowly over land, and continues to bring intense rain
bands and tropical storm force wind gusts into Mississippi and
Alabama.  A High Risk for excessive rainfall remains in place for
eastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi along with the ongoing
threat for dangerous coastal flooding along the Central Gulf
Coast.  Cristobal is expected to bring a several inches of heavy
rain just west of the Mississippi River together with gusty winds
and isolated severe weather during the next couple of days.

Meanwhile, an anomalously cold and vigorous upper trough for early
June continues to swing through the western U.S. and into the
northern Plains.  Strong to severe storms will be likely early
this morning, and they are expected to redevelop later this
afternoon as a cold front slowly works its way across the region. 
While the severe thunderstorms are occurring in the northern
Plains, snow is developing in the northern Rockies under the cold
upper trough.  Some of the higher elevations of southwest Montana
into the Yellowstone National Park could see heavy snow today
before the snow tapers off by tonight. The snow will spread into
the higher elevations of the central Rockies as well.

By Tuesday, the anomalously cold upper trough will advance across
the Great Plains as Cristobal spreads tropical heavy rains up the
Mississippi Valley.  These two systems with highly contrasting
characteristics will begin to interact with one another.  This
intricate interaction will eventually result in a strong low
pressure to track across the Great Lakes by early Wednesday. 
Models still show plenty of uncertainty as to how this interaction
will play out.  But do expect a good chance of strong to severe
thunderstorms to re-develop across the northern Plains to the
upper Midwest Tuesday night as the tropical rains associated with
Cristobal head toward the Great Lakes.  In addition, windy
conditions should expand across the entire northern part of the
U.S. as the two systems merge into an intense low pressure system
over the Great Lakes early on Wednesday.

Temperature-wise, a strong cold front ushers in a very cool
air-mass for early June across the West and will only lower the
fire danger slightly across the Southwest by Tuesday. Temperatures
look to be cold enough that Frost Advisories and Freeze Warnings
have been posted for parts of the Great Basin and Intermountain

While the wind speeds associated with Cristobal have dropped after
it moved inland along the Central Gulf Coast, the storm will
continue to bring a very large region of dangerous weather from
the Central Gulf Coast, northward through the Mississippi Valley,
Lower Ohio Valley and into the Upper Great Lakes.  Widespread
heavy rains, flash flooding and flooding are possible tonight as
Cristobal moves northward through the Lower  Mississippi Valley
and into the Middle to Upper Mississippi Valley/Upper Great Lakes
region Tuesday into Wednesday.  Rainfall totals across these areas
are expected to be 2 to 4 inches with localized totals of 6""+.  In
addition, severe weather with possible tornadoes and high winds
are possible across these areas.

To the west of Cristobal, a strong cold front will be pressing
slowly eastward into the Plains and Upper Mississippi Valley
tonight into Tuesday.  There is the potential for widespread heavy
rains, flash flooding and severe weather along this front from
central Nebraska, eastern South Dakota, far eastern North Dakota
into northwest Minnesota.

The southern portion of the strong front moving through the Plains
is not expected to have much precipitation associated with it. 
However, in its wake, windy conditions are likely from the
Southern High Plains, westward across the Southwest and into
Southern California.  The combination of these high winds and low
relative humidities will produced elevated to critical fire
weather conditions across these areas. 

Temperature-wise, the widespread below average temperatures
currently across the Rockies and Great Basin will push eastward

Tropical depression Cristobal has continued to move well inland
across Missouri this morning, bringing tropical downpours and
gusty winds near its track.  The depression is expected to move
steadily toward the north and then north-northeast across the
Midwest this afternoon.  In the mean time, a sharp cold front in
conjunction with an anomalously deep and energetic upper trough is
pushing eastward across the Plains.  A complex interaction among
Cristobal, the sharp front, and the deep upper trough will result
in a variety of active weather from the central to the northern
portions of the country through Wednesday morning.  While strong
to severe thunderstorms are occurring across northern Plains
behind the sharp front, snow will continue for a while over
central Colorado before a low pressure system quickly forms over
the central Plains, bringing a quick burst of strong gusty winds,
heavy showers and possibly thunderstorms for the central High
Plains later today and tonight.  Meanwhile, Cristobal is forecast
to intensify and become post-tropical later today as the energetic
upper trough approaches from the west.  Winds are forecast to
reach gale force over the waters of the Great Lakes as the
post-tropical cyclone passes in a close distance early on
Wednesday.  Heavy downpours can also be expected near the track of
Cristobal.  The Great Lakes will continue to see showery and windy
conditions into Wednesday as the complex system intensifies
further and heads into eastern Canada early on Thursday.

The southern portion of the strong front moving through the Plains
is not expected to have much precipitation associated with it. 
However, in its wake, windy conditions are likely from the
southern High Plains, westward across the Southwest and into
Southern California.  The combination of these high winds and low

Tropical Depression Cristobal has continued to move well inland
across northern Missouri this afternoon, bringing tropical
downpours and gusty winds near its track. The depression is
expected to move steadily toward the north-northeast across the
Midwest and into the upper Great Lakes tonight, while finally
losing its tropical characteristics.  In the mean time, a sharp
cold front in conjunction with an anomalously deep and energetic
upper trough is pushing eastward across the Plains. A complex
interaction among Cristobal, the sharp front, and the deep upper
trough will result in a variety of active weather from the central
to the northern portions of the country through Wednesday morning.
Strong to severe thunderstorms are possible across the central
Plains behind the sharp front bringing a quick burst of strong
gusty winds. Heavy rain associated with the influx of tropical
moisture will result in possible flash flooding from northern
Kansas to Wisconsin. Meanwhile, once Cristobal reaches the Upper
Great Lakes region tonight, it is forecast to intensify as a
post-tropical storm as the energetic upper trough approaches from
the west. Winds are forecast to reach gale force over the waters
of the Great Lakes as the system passes in a close distance early
on Wednesday. The Great Lakes will continue to see showery and
windy conditions into Wednesday as the complex system intensifies
further and heads into eastern Canada early on Thursday.

The southern portion of the strong front moving through the Plains
is not expected to have much precipitation associated with it
today. However, in its wake, windy conditions are likely across
the southern High Plains and into Southern California. The
combination of these high winds and low relative humidities will
produce elevated to critical fire weather conditions across these
areas. 

The threat for severe thunderstorms will shift east on Wednesday
across the Ohio Valley, Lower Great Lakes, and Interior Northeast.
A potent cold front will be the trigger for these storms, with
strong winds and isolated tornadoes possible mainly across lower
Michigan and Ohio. This front will slowly push towards the East
Coast coast on Thursday, bringing the chances of showers and

and southern Plains, high winds in the Intermountain West...

Much of the Lower 48 can expect a mostly dry end to work-week and
start to the weekend. A couple regions will still need the
umbrella handy, however, with the coastal Southeast at risk for
the heaviest rainfall totals. The active setup along the Southeast
coast is due to a quasi-stationary frontal boundary that will act
to trigger showers and thunderstorms. Rainfall could be very heavy
at times today and with overly saturated soil in place, a Slight
Risk for flash flooding has been issued for the Southeast coast.
Showers and thunderstorms look to remain in the forecast
throughout the weekend along the Southeast coast with localized
flash flooding possible. Rainfall chances increase in the southern
Appalachians the second half of the weekend as an upper level
disturbance deepens over the region starting Sunday.

Wet conditions are also anticipated from the Sierra Nevada to the
Northwest today thanks to a potent upper level trough tracking
over the West Coast. Scattered showers and storms will pass
through the Northwest with some severe storms possible in the
northern Rockies this afternoon and evening. A strong cold front
will usher in below normal temperatures along the West Coast today
followed by the Great Basin and northern Rockies on Saturday.
While the West cools down this weekend, the Plains are likely to
be mired in hot temperatures today and Saturday as high
temperatures exceeding 90 degrees stretch from Texas on north to
the high plains of Montana.

The combination of an intensifying low pressure system over the
Northwest and strong high pressure over the Great Lakes will make
for a windy Friday and weekend over the Great Basin, the southern
Rockies, and the southern High Plains. The combination of dry
thunderstorms along with low humidity and windy conditions over
parts of the Great Basin and these regions will aid in producing
favorable fire weather conditions today into the weekend. Some
winds could be quite strong as high wind warnings and watches have
been posted for parts of the Great Basin today and northern
Rockies on Saturday where wind gusts could reach as high as 60
miles per hour."

weekend...

...Elevated to critical fire risk continues over the Great Basin

Heavy rainfall and thunderstorms will continue across the
Southeast coast tonight along a stationary boundary extending from
the Gulf of Mexico up and through the Carolina coast. A Slight
Risk of Excessive Rainfall is in effect for this area as a result.
This frontal pattern will persist through the weekend and into the
beginning of the work week, but most of the heaviest rainfall will
remain offshore. We're monitoring a chance for localized heavy
rainfall over the Central Appalachians next week.

Rain along with cool maritime air will return to the Pacific
Northwest this weekend following a low pressure system that is
currently moving across the Great Basin and Intermountain West,
all underneath a deep upper level trough. Snowfall may fall over
higher elevations of the Northern Rockies. Building high pressure
over Ontario will continue to push a cold front down through the
Northeast and into the Mid-Atlantic bringing with it below average
temperatures to those areas this weekend. High pressure will be
nestled between the two troughs over the Great Plains. This will
generate above average heat for the Rockies and Great Plains this
weekend. Temperatures will be particularly higher over the
Northern Rockies/Plains on Saturday as highs are likely to be 30
degrees above average in certain places.

The Storm Prediction Center continued its issuance of Elevated and
Critical Risk of Fire Weather for parts of the Great Basin and
Southwest. This, due in-part by the previously mentioned
upper-level ridge producing heat and dry conditions over this
region. Dry thunderstorms and high winds will also contribute to
the risk of fires this weekend."

A stalled frontal boundary along the Southeast coast will be
responsible for producing a wet weekend with daily episodes of
showers and thunderstorms. Rainfall could be heavy at times today
with the area most at risk for potential flash flooding stretching
from the Florida Panhandle on north to the North Carolina Outer
Banks. By Sunday, an upper-level low tracks into the southern
Appalachians and a moist southeasterly fetch will develop, forcing
rain to develop across the region. Flash flooding is possible
there on Sunday in addition to the ongoing flood threat along the
Southeast coast. The upper low is forecast to become cut off over
the region keeping wet conditions and the potential for flooding
into the start of the upcoming week.

The eastern and western thirds of the Lower 48 can expect a fairly
cool weekend as a pair of cold fronts usher in below normal
temperatures. The Northwest can expect not only cool temperatures
but also passing showers and a few thunderstorms. Sunday's
intermission featuring a few lingering showers ends abruptly as
yet another storm system rolls in on Monday. Meanwhile, farther
east, the Great Lakes and Northeast is under the influence of a
large dome of high pressure throughout the weekend. Abnormally
cool temperatures and mostly dry conditions are on tap in these
regions into the start of the week. Sandwiched between the cooler
air-masses stationed along the coasts of the U.S. are summer-like
temperatures over the Plains. High temps should make a run at the
mid-upper 90s each afternoon in the Plains. In addition, there
will be a chance for thunderstorms each day with the best odds of
severe weather occurring in the northern High Plains.

The Storm Prediction Center continues to issue Elevated and
Critical Risks of fire weather for parts of the Southwest and
southern Plains. This is due to the ongoing combination of dry,
windy, and hot conditions, which are forecast to continue into
Monday. Dry thunderstorms and high winds will also contribute to
the risk of fires this weekend. The northern Rockies brace for a
windy Saturday as wind gusts could climb as high as 60 miles per
hour."

In the East, an upper-level trough is forecast to sink southward
and become cut off from the main jet stream to the north. This
slow-moving upper-level low, along with a stationary front along
the Atlantic coast and moisture flowing in, will lead to
persistent rainfall over portions of the East. The heaviest
rainfall of 1 to 3 inches is expected over the Central/Southern
Appalachians and near the coast of the Carolinas, and Marginal
Risks of flash flooding are in place. Southern Florida could also
rainfall totals locally over 2 inches through Monday. Temperatures
will be cooler than normal for the Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, and
the Eastern Seaboard.

Upper-level troughing is also expected to persist over the
northwestern U.S. through the beginning of next week as instances
of upper-level energy move through and reinforce it. This will
cause below normal temperatures to continue particularly across
the Northwest through Monday, where highs each day should be 10 to
20 degrees below normal. Additionally, precipitation is
expected--mostly rain, but some snow could fall in the Northern
Rockies and Cascades considering the cool temperatures. Severe
thunderstorms are also a possibility. Northwestern Montana has a
Slight Risk of severe storms in place from the Storm Prediction
Center through tonight, and strong storms are possible throughout
much of the High Plains. On Sunday, the severe risk should focus
over the Northern Plains.

Ahead of the western trough, gusty winds and mainly dry conditions
(besides a few scattered afternoon thunderstorms) are forecast
across the Southwest, Rockies, and Plains. Critical fire weather
is expected for portions of the Four Corners states and the
Southern/Central High Plains through the next few days, and Red
Flag Warnings are in effect. The upper-level ridge in between the
two troughs should help cause hot temperatures across the Plains
through early next week, with temperatures in the 90s as far north
as South Dakota."

High pressure in control over much of the eastern U.S. makes for a
cooler and mostly dry Sunday and Monday from the Great Lakes to
the Northeast. Farther south, however, a stalled frontal boundary
draped along the Southeast coast and a developing upper-level low
in the eastern Ohio Valley look to generate wet weather across the
Southeast and southern Appalachians. Rainfall totals through early
Tuesday morning are forecast to be highest along the coastal
Carolinas where 2 to 4 inches of rain expected. Rainfall rates
could become intense at times with the potential for localized
flooding both Sunday and Monday. Heavy showers and thunderstorms
should extend as far south as South Florida both Sunday and
Monday. To the west, upslope flow as a result of the developing
upper low over the eastern Ohio Valley leads to periods of rain in
the southern and central Appalachians. Rainfall totals could range
between 1 to 2 inches in southern West Virginia, southwest
Virginia, and western North Carolina. In addition to the rain,
very cool temperatures for mid-June are expected to persist into
the first half of the week.

The Northwest will also contend with its own stretch of cool and
dreary weather thanks to a pair of upper-level disturbances
tracking overhead. Precipitation will fall primarily in the form
of rain, but some snow could fall in the Northern Rockies and
Cascades due to the considerably cooler temperatures. Sandwiched
between the cooler temperature regimes in the Northwest and the
East are hotter than normal temperatures enveloping the Plains and
Upper Midwest today and into the first half of the week. A passing
cold front looks to trigger thunderstorms over the northern Plains
today, most notably in the Dakotas where a Slight Risk for severe
weather is in place. The threat for severe storms diminishes over
the North Central U.S. on Monday, but still cannot be ruled out.

Ahead of the western trough, gusty winds and low humidity levels
are forecast across the Southwest, Rockies, and Plains. Some
thunderstorms are possible over the southern and central Rockies
but little in the way of beneficial rainfall is expected. Critical
fire weather is expected in portions of the Four Corners states
and the Southern/Central High Plains today as Red Flag Warnings
are in effect. Elevated risks for fire weather conditions are
likely to continue into the first half of the upcoming week due to
the continual presence of upper level troughing over the Northwest."

High pressure in control over much of the eastern U.S. makes for a
cooler and mostly dry Sunday and Monday from the Great Lakes to
the Northeast. Farther south, however, a stalled frontal boundary
draped along the Carolina coast and an upper-level low over the
Ohio Valley should generate wet weather across the
Central/Southern Appalachians through tomorrow and the Carolinas
through the first half of the week. 1 to 2 inches of rain are
possible in portions of the Appalachians along with potentially
strong thunderstorms before rain chances wind down late Monday
there. Rainfall totals through Tuesday evening are forecast to be
highest along the coastal Carolinas, where 3 to 5 inches of rain
are expected. Rainfall rates could become intense at times, and
flooding and flash flooding are possible through Tuesday. South
Florida could also see some showers and thunderstorms with this
system. In addition to the rain, very cool temperatures for
mid-June are expected to persist into the first half of the week,
with highs in the 70s and even 60s as far south as North Carolina.

The Northwest will also contend with its own stretch of cool and
dreary weather thanks to a pair of upper-level disturbances
tracking overhead. Precipitation will fall primarily in the form
of rain, but some snow could fall in the Northern Rockies and
Cascades due to cooler temperatures than normal. Precipitation
totals should be 1 to 2 inches in favored upslope areas.
Meanwhile, ahead of the upper-level trough, ridging is forecast to
persist over the Plains and build into the Midwest through the
first half of the week, causing much above normal temperatures.
Severe thunderstorms are possible through tonight along a cold
front, and there is a Slight Risk of severe weather in place over
portions of the Dakotas, with potential for another round of
strong storms on Tuesday.

Ahead of the western trough, gusty winds and low humidity levels
are forecast across the Southwest, Rockies, and Plains. Isolated
diurnal thunderstorms are possible over the Southern Rockies, but
little in the way of beneficial rainfall is expected. Critical
Risks of fire weather are indicated for portions of the Four

A stalled frontal boundary draped along the Carolina coast and a
cut-off upper level low over the eastern Ohio Valley will work in
tandem to make the first half of the week a wet one in the
Southeast. The heaviest rainfall totals through Wednesday morning
are forecast to be over eastern North Carolina where 3 to 5 inches
are expected with locally higher amounts possible. The combination
of elevated moisture content, deep convection, and overly
saturated soil are a recipe for flash flooding, hence the Slight
Risk areas for excessive rainfall in eastern North Carolina. In
addition to the heavy rain, overcast skies and onshore/upslope
flow should force temperatures to be considerably cooler than
normal. Parts of the southern Mid-Atlantic and Carolinas may have
a tough time surpassing the low 70s both today and Tuesday.

The Northwest will also contend with its own stretch of cool and
dreary weather thanks to a pair of upper-level disturbances
tracking overhead. Precipitation will fall primarily in the form
of rain, but some snow could fall in the Northern Rockies and
Cascades due to considerably cooler temperatures than normal.
Precipitation totals should range between 1 to 2 inches in favored
upslope areas. Farther east, high pressure in control of  Great
Lakes to the Northeast will keep both regions mostly dry.
Temperatures remain on the seasonally cooler side again today but
should moderate closer to near normal levels by Tuesday. Stuck in
between these cooler temperature regimes is upper level ridging
over the northern Plains and build into the Midwest through the
first half of the week, causing abnormally hot conditions to take
shape. Severe thunderstorms are possible in the Upper Midwest this
afternoon ahead of a weakening frontal boundary. The next round of
severe weather arrives in the northern High Plains on Tuesday as a
new area of low pressure develops over the region.

Meanwhile the Southwest, Rockies, and south-central High Plains
remain mired in a pattern favorable for enhanced fire weather
conditions with prolonged gusty winds, low humidity, and drier
than normal conditions. Isolated diurnal thunderstorms are
possible over the Southern Rockies, but little in the way of
beneficial rainfall is expected. Critical Risks of fire weather
are in place for portions of the Great Basin and Four Corners
states through Tuesday, along with a long stretch of Red Flag
warnings from California's central Sierra Nevada to the central
High Plains. Elevated to critical fire weather conditions are
likely to continue into the first half of the upcoming week due to
the continual presence of upper-level troughing over the
Northwest. Look for favorable fire weather conditions to persist
into the middle of the week over the Four Corners region."

...Rain and cool weather for the Southeast/Mid-Atlantic and
Northwest, and hot conditions for the central and northern
Plains...

The weather pattern will be rather slow to change through the
middle of this week with upper level lows over the Pacific
Northwest and the Carolinas.  An upper level ridge and surface
high over the Great Lakes and Northeast north of the southeast
U.S. low is resulting in a Rex block, and therefore slower than
average progression of major weather systems.

One of the stories that will make weather headlines through
Wednesday will be moderate to heavy rain from the southern
Appalachians to the Mid-Atlantic region.  The combination of the
closed upper low and a weak disturbance off the coast will
generate enough moisture and lift in the atmosphere to produce 1
to 3 inches of rain across much of North Carolina and southern
Virginia, and perhaps even higher across the Outer Banks of North
Carolina.  Given saturated soils across much of this region, the
additional rain justifies the Slight Risk of excessive rainfall
from WPC.  Temperatures will also be anomalously cool for
mid-June, with some record low maximum temperatures possible as
highs struggle to reach 70 degrees for some of these areas.  The
northwestern quadrant of the nation will also enjoy cool weather
for this time of year courtesy of another upper low and cold front
passing through.  Some of the highest elevations of the northern
Rockies may get accumulating snow, particularly for central Idaho
and southwest Montana on Tuesday.

Elsewhere across the continental U.S., a cold front will track
eastward across the Intermountain West and then the Rockies and
western High Plains by Wednesday evening.  Highs will be above
normal for many areas from Kansas to Minnesota ahead of this
front, with widespread 90s likely."

A pesky cut-off upper low over the Southeast is in no hurry to
leave just yet, keeping below normal temperatures and wet
conditions in the forecast across the southern Mid-Atlantic. The
seemingly endless supply of moisture looks to drop an additional 2
to 5 inches of rain in eastern North Carolina through mid-week
with flash flooding also possible. The upper low and an associated
surface low off the Carolina coast will slowly drift north by
Wednesday, causing the axis of heavy rainfall to head north into
southern and central Virginia. Rainfall totals ranging between 1
to 2 inches are possible along the Blue Ridge mountains of western
Virginia. Temperatures feel more like April rather than mid-June
in parts of the Carolinas and southern Virginia. Some record low
maximum temperatures are possible as highs struggle to reach 70
degrees for some of these areas. Temperatures will slowly but
surely rise throughout the week, but any temperatures returning to
normal levels may have to wait until the weekend.

The northwestern U.S. will also witness cooler weather for this
time of year courtesy of another upper low and cold frontal
passage. Some of the highest elevations of the northern Rockies
may receive accumulating snow, particularly for central Idaho and
southwest Montana today where winter storm watches remain in
effect this morning. While seasonally cool temperatures look to
stick around in the northern Rockies, the Pacific Northwest along
with northern and central California should see temperatures
rebound more seasonal levels on Wednesday, and then above normal
by the second half of the week.

Elsewhere across the Lower 48, the Great Plains and Upper Midwest
find themselves in the warm sector ahead of an approaching cold
front over the Rockies. This is forcing much above normal
temperatures to transpire for many areas from Kansas and  Colorado
to Minnesota ahead of this front, with widespread 90s on tap. Some
severe weather is also possible across the Dakotas through
Wednesday as the front slowly progresses eastward. To the
Southwest, elevated to critical fire weather conditions, thanks to
prolonged breezy and very dry conditions. Red Flag warnings remain

A slow-moving upper-level low will continue to bring at least a
couple more days of cool and wet weather for the Mid-Atlantic
region and down into the Carolinas. Up to a couple of inches of
additional rain can be expected for parts of Virginia and North
Carolina where flash flooding remains a possibility into Wednesday
morning.  The upper low will gradually weaken with time and the
threat of heavy across the Mid-Atlantic will slowly ease on
Wednesday.  However, scattered areas of rain and a few
thunderstorms can be expected to edge further north and west
toward the northern Mid-Atlantic, central Appalachians, and the
lower Great Lakes Wednesday night into early Thursday.

The northwestern U.S. will also witness cool and damp weather
courtesy of a large cool air mass associated with yet another
anomalous upper low.  Some of the highest elevations of the
northern Rockies can expect to receive accumulating snow,
particularly for central Idaho into northwest Wyoming tonight into
Wednesday where winter storm watches and warnings remain in
effect.  While seasonally cool temperatures look to stick around
in the northern Rockies, the Pacific Northwest along with northern
and central California should see temperatures rebound more
seasonal levels on Wednesday, and then above normal by the second
half of the week.

Elsewhere across the Lower 48, the Great Plains and Upper Midwest

axis of heavy rainfall also pushes north into the Mid-Atlantic
today. Rainfall totals in western and central Virginia can expect
between 1 to 2 inches of rainfall through Friday morning, with
localized amounts as high as 3 inches in the Blue Ridge mountains.
As the upper low gradually weakens on Thursday, showers and storms
should become more scattered in nature and cover more real estate
as the threat for showers and portions reaches the eastern Ohio
Valley and northern Mid-Atlantic. Considerably cooler temperatures
look to stick around from Georgia to Maryland today with a slight
warming trend taking shape by Thursday. Farther south, showers and
thunderstorms will fire over much of central and southern Florida
on Thursday and persist into Friday morning.

The summer solstice is this Saturday but someone forgot to tell
that to Old Man Winter as heavy mountain snow piles up over
portions of the northern Rockies this morning. This is due to an
intense upper low swinging through the region today that is
accompanied by temperature anomalies ranging between 15 to 20
degrees below normal throughout the region. Winter Storm Warnings
have been issued for parts of north-central Idaho and southwest
Montana along with some frost advisories in northern Nevada, far
northern California, and south-central Oregon. The valleys and
lower elevations of the northern Rockies and High Plains can
expect rain to be the primary precipitation type. While seasonally
cool temperatures look to stick around in the northern Rockies,
the Pacific Northwest along with northern and central California
should see temperatures rebound to more seasonal levels today,
then become above normal the second half of the week.

Elsewhere across the nation, the northern Plains and Upper Midwest
will be in the warm sector ahead of an approaching cold front with
high temperatures soaring into 90s today. Some parts of the
central High Plains could also make a run at triple digits for
high temps this afternoon. Cooler conditions arrive in the
northern Plains on Thursday in wake of the cold frontal passage.
Severe weather is possible across the Dakotas into northern

The upper-level low responsible for the soaking rainfall in the
Carolinas the last several days will gradually weaken as it begins
to move slowly toward the north.  The associated scattered showers
and thunderstorms are expected to edge slowly to the north and
west across the Mid-Atlantic, central Appalachians, eastern Ohio
Valley and into the lower Great Lakes during the next couple of
days.  The highest chance of rain is expected to be across parts
of the Mid-Atlantic and along the central and southern
Appalachians where an inch or more of rainfall can be expected

thunderstorms will continue across the Carolinas.  Farther south,
a good chance of showers and thunderstorms will linger over much
of the Florida Peninsula through Friday.  Much of the East Coast
will remain cool and damp under the slow-moving upper low.  The
exception will be in New England where afternoon high temperatures
will soar into the 80s.

In contrast, hot conditions will spread eastward from the northern
Plains toward the upper Midwest where high temperatures soaring
well up into the 90s are forecast for the next couple of days. 
Some parts of the central High Plains could also make a run for

be expected over portions of the northern Rockies through Thursday
morning before tapering off later on Thursday.  Many places in
this area will see temperatures more than 20 degrees below normal

Mid-Atlantic, Ohio Valley, and Carolinas with locally heavy
downpours possible. Temperatures look to remain on the seasonally
cool side again on Thursday, but as the upper low weakens,
temperatures will gradually warm to the point where highs in the
80s return by the weekend. Farther south, upward motion aloft over
Florida and an influx of tropical moisture make for a stormy
couple of days, especially over central and southern Florida.
Rainfall totals in excess of two inches could occur within strong
thunderstorms.

While summer heat remains on hiatus in the Southeast and
Mid-Atlantic, summer is in full swing over the southern Plains,
Midwest, Great Lakes, and New England. High temps in these regions
are forecast to range between the upper 80s and low 90s. Daily
episodes of severe storms are possible today from the Midwest
stretching south to the southern Plains as a cold front approaches

A slow-moving upper-level low that has brought cool and wet
weather across the Mid-Atlantic into the central Appalachians will
continue to gradually weaken.  Showers and a few thunderstorms
associated with this system will gradually become more widely
scattered with time.  In fact, some breaks in the overcast skies
can be expected during the afternoon, allowing for periods of
party sunny skies.  However, the strong June sunshine will tend to
trigger new rounds of scattered showers from late afternoon into
the evening hours for some areas along the East Coast into the
Ohio Valley through Saturday.  As the upper low weakens,
temperatures will gradually warm to the point where highs in the
80s return by the weekend.  In contrast, full sunshine will raise
afternoon temperatures well into the 90s across northern New
England, where record high temperatures are possible for the next
couple of days at a few locations.  Farther south, upward motion
aloft over Florida and an influx of tropical moisture make for a
stormy couple of days, especially over central and southern
Florida.  Rainfall totals in excess of two inches could occur
within strong thunderstorms.

Meanwhile, summer heat continues from the southern Plains across
the Midwest and into the Great Lakes.  High temps in these regions
are forecast to range between the upper 80s and low 90s.  Daily
episodes of severe storms are possible today from the Midwest
stretching south to the southern Plains as a cold front approaches
from the northern Plains. The severe threat diminishes in the
Midwest on Friday but severe storms are expected to fire again in
the southern High Plains on Friday.  Behind the cold front, very
cool temperatures over the Intermountain West will filter into the
northern and central High Plains.  The core of the cool air will
spread from the northern and central Rockies into the central High
Plains by Friday.

Much of the West Coast should remain rain-free into the start of
the weekend with above normal temperatures spreading from the the
Pacific Northwest on south to the San Joaquin Valley, reaching the
Great Basin on Saturday.  In the Southwest, some good news as fire

are forecast to range between the upper 80s and low 90s.  Rain is
expected across the Midwest into Sunday near a stalled front, with
the severe weather threat focused in the southern Plains on
Friday.  Behind the cold front, temperatures will remain moderate
across the Northern Plains.

Out East, a slow-moving upper-level low that has brought mild and
wet weather across the Mid-Atlantic into the central Appalachians
will continue to gradually weaken while edging eastward, allowing
temperatures to slowly moderate.  Showers and thunderstorms
associated with this system will become more widely scattered with

As moisture flows into the vicinity of a couple frontal boundaries
and ahead of a dryline, the Plains and portions of the Mississippi
Valley can expect scattered thunderstorms through the beginning of
next week. Through tonight, Slight Risks of severe weather are
outlooked by the Storm Prediction Center for parts of the Plains.
Isolated higher rainfall totals causing flash flooding are
possible, especially for portions of southern Oklahoma and far
northern Texas. On Sunday and Monday, the Storm Prediction Center
again has Slight to Enhanced Risk of severe weather in place for
the Central/Southern Plains into the Middle Mississippi Valley.
With a couple of inches of rain possible each day, Slight Risks of
flash flooding are delineated mainly for parts of Oklahoma as
well.

Farther east, unsettled weather is also expected for the Ohio and
Tennessee Valleys toward the Eastern Seaboard, with scattered
thunderstorms forecast. Widespread severe weather or flash
flooding are not likely in those areas, though through tonight the
Carolina/Georgia coast could see a few strong storms, and isolated
instances of flash flooding are possible in the Mid-Atlantic. Rain
and thunderstorm chances should increase across the Midwest to
Great Lakes region on Monday ahead of a low pressure system.
Elsewhere, a front moving through the Northwest could trigger
showers and isolated thunderstorms through tonight, drying out on
Sunday.

The most anomalous temperature departures from normal over the
next few days are forecast for the Northeast, where highs nearing

and thunderstorms should continue across the Eastern Seaboard back
into to the Southern Plains on Wednesday.

The front will also cool temperatures behind it--after a hot
Monday in the Southern High Plains, with temperatures well above
100 degrees, 80s to low 90s are expected the next couple of days
there. Highs of 5 to 10 degrees below normal are forecast to push

In the West, an upper-level disturbance should approach and push a
cold front into the Pacific Northwest and eventually into the
Northern Plains and Great Basin Thursday into Friday and the
Midwest/Great Lakes on Friday. This will lead showers and
thunderstorms in the Great Basin and Northern Rockies Wednesday
and into the Northern Plains on Thursday -- the Storm Prediction
Center targets the Northern Plains for a Slight Risk of severe

with heavy rainfall shift into the Central Plains and Great Lakes.
 High temperatures 5 to 15 degrees above normal are forecast

The Florida Peninsula will also be heating up and drying out with
decreasing thunderstorm activity, particularly Thursday onward, as
the Bermuda High builds and shifts northward; record highs are
possible both Thursday and Friday.  Heat advisories have recently
been hoisted for southwest Florida.  This strengthening and
shifting of the Bermuda High, climatological for late June/July,
will allow the Saharan dust layer underneath of it which has
overspread the Caribbean Sea and was approaching the southeastern
Bahamas at sunset on Tuesday to progress into the Florida
Peninsula and Gulf Coast in the coming days.  The main impacts of

rainfall through tonight for the western to central Gulf Coast
region.  The highest chance of heavy rain and flash flooding is
expected to be across southern Louisiana, whereas the greatest
threat of severe thunderstorms will be farther east over parts of

before the front slides very slowly off the East Coast on Friday. 
Florida may see less chance of thunderstorms during the next
couple of days leading to day-time high temperatures nearing

...Saharan dust to arrive over the Gulf Coast states...

...Hot weather to persist across parts of Florida and the interior

An upper-level disturbance over southeast Texas will continue to
favor a threat for some heavy rain and perhaps localized flash
flooding across the western and central Gulf Coast region today as
it interacts with moisture pooled along a weakening stationary
front. Conditions are then expected to gradually dry out a bit
across the Gulf Coast states going through Friday and into the
early part of the weekend as the western edge of the Bermuda high
offshore of the Southeast begins to nose westward across Florida
and the Deep South. This will generally favor hot temperatures
across this region, although areas farther west across eastern and
southern Texas will still see some unsettled weather with more
clouds and a threat of showers and thunderstorms at least through
Friday along with cooler temperatures.

The building ridge of high pressure will also allow a Saharan dust
layer to progress into much of the Gulf Coast region over the next
couple of days. The main impacts of the Saharan dust will be hazy
skies during the day, locally reduced visibility and degraded air
quality. However, this will also make for some very colorful
sunrises and sunsets with deeper oranges and reds compared to
normal.

In the West, an upper-level trough currently advancing across the
Intermountain Region will push a cold front out across the
northern and central Plains later today and then toward the upper
Midwest and upper Great Lakes by later Friday. This will drive a
threat of strong to severe thunderstorms, including a threat for
large hail and damaging winds across these areas. Locally heavy
rainfall will be expected too as showers and thunderstorms develop
and expand eastward with the front, and there will be at least a
localized concern for flash flooding. High temperatures 5 to 10
degrees above normal are forecast across the northern and central
Plains today ahead of the cold front. Removed from active weather

...The threat of strong to severe thunderstorms will spread across
the northern Plains this evening, reaching the Northeast on
Saturday...

...Saharan dust to arrive over the Gulf Coast states...

...Very hot conditions persist across parts of Florida and
interior valleys of California...

The upper-level disturbance over southeast Texas responsible for
recent heavy rainfall across the Gulf Coast region will gradually
weaken.  This will allow the threat of heavy rain and strong
thunderstorms to slowly diminish.  However, bouts of thunderstorms
are still expected, especially during late afternoon into the
evening for the next couple of days.  Farther to the east, the
western edge of the Bermuda high offshore of the Southeast will
begin to nose westward across Florida toward the Deep South.  This
will tend to suppress thunderstorm activities and allow afternoon
temperatures to soar well up into the 90s for much of the Sunshine
State into the weekend.  Record high temperatures could be
challenged over central Florida during the next few days.

The building ridge of high pressure will also allow a Saharan dust
layer to progress into much of the Gulf Coast region over the next
couple of days.  The main impacts of the Saharan dust will be hazy
skies during the day, locally reduced visibility and degraded air
quality.  However, this will also make for some very colorful
sunrises and sunsets with deeper oranges and reds compared to
normal.

Across the northern Plains, an upper-level trough will continue to
advance a cold front eastward into the upper Great Lakes late on
Friday before heading toward New England on Saturday.  This will
raise the threat of strong to severe thunderstorms, including a
threat for large hail and damaging winds from west to east across
these areas during the next couple of days.  Locally heavy
rainfall can also be expected as showers and thunderstorms develop
and expand eastward ahead of the front, with localized concern for
flash flooding.  High temperatures into the 90s are forecast to
spread from the Midwest on Friday reaching the Mid-Atlantic into
the Northeast on Saturday.

In the West, the interior valleys of California are expected to
remain hot with temperatures as much as 10 to 15 degrees above
normal over the next few days, where Heat Advisories remain in
place.  Meanwhile, a low pressure system developing over the
interior Pacific Northwest and Albert in Canada on Friday is
forecast to bring showers and some thunderstorms into the northern
Rockies and northern High Plains on Saturday."

As moisture flows into the vicinity of a frontal system moving
across the Plains to Midwest, thunderstorms are expected today
across those regions. The Storm Prediction Center has outlined an
Enhanced Risk of severe weather over portions of the Midwest, with
a broader Slight Risk back into the Plains. Flash flooding is also
forecast, and a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall is also in place
for much the same area from the Central Plains to the Great Lakes
region. Farther south, some locally heavy rainfall totals of 1 to
3 inches are possible in South Texas, which could lead to flash
flooding there today as well. The northern part of the front
should shift eastward Saturday but stall over the Midwest. Thus,
the main focus for severe weather on Saturday should be across the
northern Mid-Atlantic region into southern parts of the Northeast,
while some lower risk of strong thunderstorms as well as a couple
of Slight Risks of flash flooding are forecast back toward the
Mississippi and Ohio Valleys.

Surface high pressure is expected over the Southeast, influenced
by the western edge of the Bermuda High. This flow pattern will
lead to continued inflow of Saharan dust into the southeastern
part of the country through the weekend. The main impacts of the
Saharan dust will be hazy skies during the day, locally reduced
visibility, and degraded air quality. However, this could also
make for some very colorful sunrises and sunsets with deeper
oranges and reds compared to normal. Additionally, temperatures
over Florida should be hotter than normal, and could even set
records with highs in the upper 90s.

Heat is also forecast across the West today, with highs 10 to 15
degrees above normal from northern California into Washington and
Oregon. Heat Advisories are in effect for the interior valleys of
California and for southwestern Oregon. Cooler temperatures are
expected in the Pacific Northwest Saturday before a dramatic
cooldown Sunday as a potent upper-level trough moves in. At the
surface, showers and thunderstorms could form along a cold front
in the Northwest on Saturday, but rain totals will ramp up even
more early next week. Farther south, conditions are forecast to be
favorable for fire weather, with gusty winds, low humidity, and
the potential for dry thunderstorms. The Storm Prediction Center

A cold front is forecast to slowly move southward down the East
Seaboard during the next couple of days as the trailing end of the
front remains nearly stationary across the Ohio Valley and
Midwest.  This will favor bouts of scattered thunderstorms to move
from the upper Midwest across the lower Ohio Valley toward the
southern Appalachians into Tuesday.  Severe weather and flash
flooding can also be expected for parts of these areas.  In
addition, severe weather is possible across southern New England
through this evening as a low pressure system slowly develops both
at the surface and aloft.

Meanwhile, a large upper-level low is forecast to settle into much
of the western U.S. during the next few days.  This will bring a
surge of unseasonably cool to cold temperatures through the
western U.S. where high temperatures of 15 to more than 30 degrees
below average are forecast.  The upper low will also bring
widespread precipitation into the Northwest where
elevation-enhanced rain totals of 1 to 3 inches likely in the
northern Rockies.  Wet snow is even possible for higher elevations
of the northern Rockies as temperatures drop to near freezing
during the next couple of nights.  In fact, up to a foot of snow
is possible near the peaks of the Bitterroot mountains in Idaho. 
By Tuesday morning, wet snow is forecast to reach the Yellowstone
National Park, the higher elevations of northern Utah, and as far
south as the Colorado Rockies as the cold air mass continues to
plunge southward through the southern Rockies.

As the cold air plunges southward through the western U.S., an
elongated low pressure system is forecast to gradually intensify
across the Great Plains.  The chance of strong to severe
thunderstorms should increase over the northern Plains on Tuesday
as the upper low begins to lift and exit the northern Rockies. 
Meanwhile, a low pressure center is forecast to be consolidating
over the central Plains.  Although the dynamics associated with
this system appears strong, the injection of the Saharan dust from
the Gulf Coast into the system may suppress the heavy rain and
thunderstorm activities across the southern Plains on Tuesday. 
Meanwhile, widespread Red Flag Warnings and Critical Risks of fire
weather are in effect for parts of California, the central Great
Basin, and the Southwest due to gusty winds and low humidity.

A significant amount of the Saharan dust is forecast to linger
over Florida for the next few days as another dust plume from the
Sahara could reach the western Gulf Coast by Tuesday.  The main
impacts of the Saharan dust will be hazy skies during the day,
locally reduced visibility, degraded air quality, but with very

To the east of the upper-level low, thunderstorms are forecast in
the vicinity of a slow-moving surface frontal system in the
Northern Plains. A few thunderstorms could be strong today, but
should increase in intensity on Tuesday and Wednesday, leading to
Slight Risks of severe weather. Flash flooding could also be a
threat with these storms, and similarly a Marginal Risk is

Warnings and Critical Risks of fire weather are in effect for much
of the Four Corners states today due to gusty winds and low
humidity. As a cold front moves through ahead of the upper low,
temperatures will cool and increase humidity, so the threat of
fire weather should diminish farther west and north, but remain
across the Southern Rockies to Southern High Plains Tuesday.

Farther east, a cold front is forecast to slowly move southward
down the Eastern Seaboard during the next couple of days as the
trailing end of the front remains nearly stationary across the
Ohio Valley and Midwest through Tuesday. This will favor bouts of
scattered thunderstorms across the Mississippi Valley, Ohio

mid-Mississippi Valley on Wednesday while also extending into
portions of the Deep South. Meanwhile, showers and some
thunderstorms along with seasonally cool temperatures are expected
to linger across the Northeast through midweek with above normal
temperatures making a comeback by Thursday.

As the east-central U.S. contends with showers and storms, much
drier conditions are stationed across the Southwest along with
gusty winds and low humidity. As a result, a Critical Risk of fire
weather remains in place today from southern Arizona to Southern
High Plains. By Wednesday, as the southern periphery of the
western trough lifts northward ,the Central Great Basin become
favored for the highest potential fire danger. A Critical Risk has
been issued for the region on Wednesday and the risk for favorable
fire weather conditions may last into Thursday. Elevated fire
conditions are possible as far south as the Lower Colorado River
Valley and as far east as the plains of Wyoming. Meanwhile, the
heat is the story in the South-Central U.S. this afternoon with
heat advisories in effect from eastern Kansas on South to the
potions of the western and central Gulf Coast. Heat advisories
will drag into Wednesday in parts of the Southern Plains.
Unseasonably hot conditions are also expected across the Upper
Midwest and northern Great Lakes.

While the highest concentration of Saharan dust has dissipated,
the next round impacting the western and central Gulf Coast states
today should persist into late week. The primary impacts of the
Saharan dust are hazy skies during the day, locally reduced
visibility, degraded air quality, and the potential for vividly
colorful sunrises and sunsets."
